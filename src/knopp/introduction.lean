Introduction. 

The foundation on which the structure of higher analysis rests is 
the theory of real numbers. Any strict treatment of the foundations of 
the differential and integral calculus and of related subjects must in- 
evitably start from there; and the same is true even for e. g. the cal- 
culation of roots and logarithms. The theory of real numbers first creates 
the material on which Arithmetic and Analysis can subsequently build, 
and with which they deal almost exclusively. 

The necessity for this has not always been realized. The great 
creators of the infinitesimal calculus Leibniz and Newton l and 
the no less famous men who developed it, of whom Eider 2 is the chief, 
were too intoxicated by the mighty stream of learning springing from 
the newly-discovered sources to feel obliged to criticize fundamentals. 
To them the results of the new methods were sufficient evidence for 
the security of their foundations. It was only when the stream began 
to ebb that critical analysis ventured to examine the fundamental con- 
ceptions. About the end of the 18 th century such efforts became stronger 
and stronger, chiefly owing to the powerful influence of Gauss 3 . Nearly 
a century had to pass, however, before the most essential matters could 
be considered thoroughly cleared up. 

Nowadays rigour in connection with the underlying number concept 
is the most important requirement in the treatment of any mathematical 
subject. Ever since the later decades of the past century the last word 
on the matter has been uttered, so to speak, by Weierstrass 4 in the 
sixties, and by Cantor 5 and Dedekind 6 in 1872. No lecture or treatise 



1 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, born in Leipzig in 1646, died in Hanover in 
1716. Isaac Neivton, born at Woolsthorpe in 1642, died in London in 1727. Each 
discovered the foundations of the infinitesimal calculus independently of the other. 

2 Leonhard Eider, born in Basle in 1707, died in St. Petersburg in 1783. 

3 Karl Friedrich Gauss, born at Brunswick in 1777, died at Gottingen in 1853. 

4 Karl Weierstrass, born at Ostenfelde in 1815, died in Berlin in 1897. The 
first rigorous account of the theory of real numbers which Weierstrass had expounded 
in his lectures since 1860 was given by G. Mittag-Leffler, one of his pupils, in his 
essay: Die Zahl, Einleitung zur Theone der analytischen Funktionen, The Tohoku 
Mathematical Journal, Vol. 17, pp. 157209. 1920. 

5 Georg Cantor, born in St. Petersburg in 1845, died at Halle in 1918: cf. 
Mathem. Annalen, Vol. 5, p. 123. 1872. 

6 Richard Dedekind, born at Brunswick in 1831, died there in 1916: cf. his 
book: Stetigkeit und irrationaJe Zahlen, Brunsuick 1872.

2 Introduction. 

dealing with the fundamental parts of higher analysis can claim validity 
unless it takes the refined concept of the real number as its starting- 
point. 

Hence the theory of real numbers has been stated so often and 
in so many different ways since that time that it might seem superfluous 
to give another very detailed exposition 7 : for in this book (at least in 
the later chapters) we wish to address ourselves only to those already 
acquainted with the elements of the differential and integral calculus. 
Yet it would scarcely suffice merely to point to accounts given elsewhere. 
For a theory of infinite series, as will be sufficiently clear from later 
developments, would be up in the clouds throughout, if it were not 
firmly based on the system of real numbers, the only possible foundation. 
On account of this, and in order to leave not the slightest uncertainty 
as to the hypotheses on which we shill build, we shall discuss in the 
following pages those idsas and data from the theory of real numbers 
which we shall need further on. We have no intention, however, of con- 
structing a statement of the theory compressed into smaller space but 
otherwise complete. We merely wish to make the main ideas, the most 
important questions, and the answers to them, as clear and prominent 
as possible. So far as the latter are concerned, our treatment throughout 
will certainly be detailed and without omissions; it is only in the cases 
of details of subsidiary importance, and of questions as to the complete- 
ness and uniqueness of the system of real numbers which lie outside the 
plan of this book, that we shall content ourselves with shorter indications. 



7 An account which is easy to follow and which includes all the essentials 
is given by H. v. Mangoldt, Einfuhrung in die hohere Mathematik, Vol. I, 8 th edition 
(by K. Knopp), Leipzig 1944. The treatment of G. Kozvalezvski, Grundziige 
der Differential- und Integralrechnung, 6 th edition, Leipzig 1929, is accurate and 
concise. A rigorous construction of the system of real numbers, which goes into 
the minutest details, is to be found in A. Loezvy, Lehrbuch der Algebra, Part I, 
Leipzig 1915, in A. Pnngsheim, Vorlesungen uber Zahlen- und Funktionenlehre, 
Vol. I, Part I, 2 n(1 edition, Leipzig 1923 (cf. also the review of the latter work by 
H. Hahn, Gott. gel. Anzeigen 1919, pp. 321 47), and in a book by E. Landau 
exclusively devoted to this purpose, Grundlagen der Analysis (Das Rechnen mit 
ganzen, rationalen, irrationalen, komplexen Zahlen), Leipzig 1930. A critical account 
of the whole problem is to be found in the article by F. Bachmann, Aufbau des 
Zahlensystems, in the Enzyklopadie d. math. Wissensch., Vol. I, 2 nii edition, Part I, 
article 3, Leipzig and Berlin 1938.
