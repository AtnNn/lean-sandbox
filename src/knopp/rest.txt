Chapter III. 
Series of positive terms. 

12. The first principal criterion and the two 
comparison tests. 

In this chapter we shall be concerned exclusively with series, all of 
whose terms are positive or at least non-negative numbers. If 2 a n is 
such a series, which we shall designate for brevity as a series of positive 
terms, then, since a n ^ 0, we have 

s n = *n-l + <*n ^ s n~l> 

so that the sequence (s n ) of partial sums is a monotone increasing sequence. 
Its behaviour is therefore particularly simple, since it is then determined 
by the first main criterion 46. This at once provides the following simple 

Jd fundamental 
First principal criterion. A series with positive terms either con- 
verges or else diverges to + <x> . And it is convergent if, and only if, its partial 
sums are bounded l . 

Before indicating the first applications of this fundamental theorem, 
we may facilitate its use by the following additional propositions: 
Theorem 1. If p is any positive integer, then the two series 

V) TO 

S a n and 27 a n 

7i n=/> 

converge and diverge together 2 , and when both series converge, 



1 Only boundcdness on the right (boundcdness above) comes into question, 
since an increasing sequence is invariably bounded on the left. 

2 More shortly: We "may" omit an arbitrary initial portion. For this 
reason, it is often unnecessary to indicate the limits of summation (between which 
the index n is made to vary).

12. The first principal criterion and the two comparison tests. Ill 

Proof. If s n (n = 0, J, . . .) are the partial sums of the first series, 
and s n f (n ~ />,/> + 1, . . .) those of the second, then, for n^p, 

s n ^<*o -h !+- + *-i + s n ', 

whence, for ->oo, both statements follow, even without requiring 
the terms a n to be non-negative. 

Theorem 2. If Zc n is a convergent series with positive terms, then so 
is E y n c ny if the factors y n are any positive, but bounded, numbers 3 . 

Proof. If the partial sums of 2c n remain constantly <C K and 
the factors y n < y, then the partial sums of 2y n c n obviously remain 
always < y K, which, by the fundamental criterion, proves the theorem. 

Theorem 3. // 2d n is a divergent series with positive terms, then 
so is 2d n d n , if the factors d n are any numbers with a positive 
lower bound d. 

Proof. If G > be arbitrarily chosen, then by hypothesis the 
partial sums of 2 d n , from a suitable index onwards, are all > G:d. 
From the same index onwards, the partial sums of 2d n d n are then 
> G. Thus 2& n d n is divergent. 

Both theorems are substantially contained in the following 

Theorem 4. // the factors a n satisfy the inequalities 



then the two series with positive terms 2 a n and 2a n a n converge and 
diverge together. Or otherwise expressed. Two scries with positive terms 
a n and 2a n ' converge and diverge together if two positive numbers 
a' and a" can be\assigned for which, constantly, (or at least Irom some 
n onwards) 4 

ct < < <*>"

in particular therefore if a n ' ~ a n or, a fortiori, if a n f * a n (v. 40, 5). 

Examples and Remarks. 71. 

1. If K is a bound above for the pattial sums of the series 2a n with 
positive terms, then the sum 5 of this series is < K (v. 46, 1). 

2. The geometric series. Given a> 0, and the so-called geometric series 

00 

n=0 
wu have, if a S> 1 1 then s n > and so (s n ) is certainly not bounded; the series 



8 We shall in future usually denote by c n the terms of a series assumed 
convergent, and by d n those of a series assumed divergent. 

4 Since, in this formulation of the hypotheses, division by a n occurs, the 
assumption is of course implied that a n > and never =0. Corresponding 
restrictions should be observed in the more frequent cases in the sequel.

so that the series is then convergent. Since further

forms a null sequence, by 1O, 7 and 26, 1, we at the same time obtain this

indeed certainly * < . We shall find later (see 136, 156, 189 and 210) that s = ^-.

The series is therefore convergent, with sum ^ 3. We shall see later that this sum 
coincides with the limit e of the numbers ( 1 4- j . 

6. As we remarked above that every series with positive terms represents 
a monotone increasing sequence, so we see, conversely, that every monotone in- 
creasing sequence (#, x lt . . .) may be expressed as a series with positive terms, 
provided x is positive. We need only write 

for, actually, 

and all the a n 's are T 0. 

From our fundamental theorem we shall in due course deduce criteria 
which are more special, but are also easier to manipulate. This we shall 
be enabled to do chiefly by the instrumentality of the two following "com- 
parison tests' ' *: 

Comparison test ofjthe_l^_hind. 72. 

Let 2c n and 2d n be two series zvith positive terms, already known to 
he the first convergent, the second divergent. If the terms of a given series 
2 a n , also with positive tertns, satisfy, for every n > a certain m, 

a) the condition 

<*>n ^ Cfi. 

then the series 2 a n is also convergent. //, however, for every n> a cer- 
tain m, 

b) we have constantly 

then the series 2 a n must also diverge 6 . 

Proof. By 70, 1, it suffices to establish the convergence or di- 

r/5 

vergence of 2 a n . In case a) the convergence of this series results 

oo 

at once, by 70, 2, from that of 2 c n , because by hypothesis we may, 



* German: Vergleichskriterien. (Tr.) 

fl Gauss used this criterion in 1812 (v. Werke III, p. 140). It was not, how- 
ever, formulated explicitly, nor was the following test of the 2 nd kind, before Cauchy, 
Analyse algbrique (Pans 1821). 



114 Chapter III. Series of positive terms. 

for every n > m, write a n *= y n c n , with y n <^l. In case bl the di- 

CO 

vergence results similarly 7 from that of d n , because here we may 

n=tn+l 
write a n = (5 n d n , with $ w ^> 1. 

73. Comparison test of the 2 nd kind. 

Let c n and 2 d n again denote respectively a convergent and a 
divergent series of positive terms. If the terms of a given series a l of 
positive terms satisfy, for every n^> a certain m, 

a) the conditions 



then the series 2a n is also convergent. If, however, for every n^> 
a certain m> we have 

b) constantly 



then 2 a n must also diverge. 

Proof. In case a), we have for every 



The sequence of the ratio y n = is, from a certain point on- 

wards, monotone descending, and consequently, since all its terms are 
positive, it is necessarily bounded Theorem 70, 2 now establishes the 

convergence. In case b) we have, analogously, 9 ~^ ]> ~ , so that the 

"+i a * 

ratios <J n = increase monotonely from a point onwards. But as they 

are constantly positive, they then have a positive lower bound. Theo- 
rem 70, 3 now proves the divergence. 

These comparison tests or criteria can of course only be useful 
to us if we are already acquainted with a large number of convergent 
and dhergent series with positive terms. We shall therefore have to 
lay in as large a stock as possible, so to speak, of series whose con- 
vergence or divergence is known. For this purpose the following 
examples may form a nucleus: 



7 Or else almost more concisely : In case a) every bound above 
of the partial sums of 2 c n is also one for the partial sums of Sa n \ and in 
case b), the partial sums of a n must ultimately exceed every bound, since 
those of 2d n do so. 



12. The first principal criterion and the two comparison tests. 115 

Examples. 

1. was seen to be divergent, 2 3 convergent. By the first comparison 74. 
test, the so-called harmonic series 

!,' 

is therefore certainly divergent for a ^ 1, convergent for a ^ 2. It is, however, 
only known in the case a ---= even integer how its sum may be related to numbers 
occurring in other connections; for instance we shall see later on that for a 4 

. 7T 4 

the sum is ^. 

2. By the preceding, the convergence or divergence of 27 - only remains 

questionable in case 1 < a < 2. We may prove as follows that the Aeries converges 
for every a * 1 : To obtain a bound above for any partial sum s n of the series, 
choose k so large that 2 k > n. Then 



Here we group in one parenthesis those terms whose indices run from a power 
of 2 (inclusive) to the next power of 2 (exclusive). Replace, in each pair of paren- 
theses, every separate term by the first; this involves an increase ot value and we 
have therefore 

2 4 2 A -- 1 

*^ 1 + 2 + 4 + + (>-.) 

If we now write for brevity r,^ ^, a positive number certainly < 1, since 
a > 1, then we have 



and since this holds for every w, the partial sums of our series are bounded, and 
the series itself is convergent, q. e. d. (Cf. 77.) 

All harmonic series 2 "^for a ^ 1 are divergent, and for a > 1, convergent. 

In these, with the geometric series, we have already quite a useful stock of com- 
parison scries. 

3. Series of the type 



where a and b are given positive numbers, also diverge for a < 1, converge for 
a > 1. For since

116 Chapter III. Series of positive terms. 

Accordingly the series 

11 ** 1

in particular, are convergent for a > 1, divergent for a 5^ 1. 

r> 

4. If 2 c n is a convergent series with positive terms, and we deduce from 

n -o 

it a new series c n ' by omitting any (possibly an infinite number) of its terms, or 
by inserting in any way terms with the value 0, thus "diluting" the series, then the 
resulting "sub-series" 2 c n f is also convergent. For every number which is a bound 
above for the partial sums of S c n is then also a bound above for those of the new 
series. 

In accordance with this, the series 2 -&> where p runs through all prime in- 
tegral values, i. e. the series * 

1,1,1 ,1,J_, 

2<x i" ga i" ^a T 7<x i H<x ~r 

is certainly convergent for cc > 1 . (On the other hand, of course, we cannot 
conclude without further examination that it diverges for a. < 1 !) 

5. Since 2 a n is already recognised as convergent for < a -< 1 , we infer 
in particular the convergence of 

V 1 -1 , _!_- 4-JLx 

n ^i io ~ 10 "*" io a "*"""*" IO B "*"""' 

If z l9 *$, > *> denote any "digits", i. e. if each of them be one of the 
numbers 0, 1, 2, . . ., 9, and if * is any integer ^-0, then, by 7O, 2, the series 



is also convergent. Thus we see that an infinite decimal fraction may also 
be regarded as an infinite series. In this sense we may say that every infinite 
decimal fraction is convergent and therefore represents a definite real number. 
In this form of series we also have, according to our customary order of ideas, 
an immediate conception of the value of its sum. 



/ 13. The root test and the ratio test. 

We prepare the way for a more systematic use of these two 
comparison tests, by the two following theorems. If we take as com- 
parison series, to begin with, the geometric series 2a n , with 0<0<1, 
then we immediately obtain the 

75. Theorem 1. //, given a series 2 a n of positive terms, we have, 
from some place onwards in the series, a n <^ a n with < a < 1, i. e. 



13. The root test and the ratio test. 1 ] 7 

then the series is convergent. It however, from some place onwards* 



then the series is divergent. (Cauchy's root test 8 .) 

Supplementary note. For divergence it clearly suffices that }/~a^>.\ 
should be known to hold for infinitely many distinct values of n. For we then 
also have, for those values of n, a n ^ 1; and a particular partial sum s m will 
consequently exceed a given (positive integral) number G, if m is chosen so 
large that the inequality a n > 1 occurs at least G times while < n < m . The 
sequence (s n ) is therefore certainly not bounded. 

The second comparison test gives immediately: 

Theorem 2. //, from some place onwards in the series, a n > 0, and 






then the series 2a n is convergent. If however, from some place 
onwards 9 



then the series 2 a n is divergent. (Cauchy's ratio test 9 .) 

Remarks and Examples. 70* 

n _ 
1. In both these theorems, it is essential for convergence that ^a n and 

- M+1 respectively should be ultimately lens than a fixed proper fraction a. It 


does not at all suffice for convergence that we should have 

V^<1, or ~^<1 

for every n. An example presents itself at once in the harmonic series 
for which we certainly always have 

1 and also -^--l^l -- <1, 



though the series diverges. It is quite essential that the root and ratio should 
not approach arbitrarily near to 1, 

2. If one of the sequences ( V^nJ or f ?"-!J is convergent, say with limit , 
then theorems 1 and 2 show that the series 27 a * is convergent if <!,

And since this value a is < 1 , theorem 1 proves the convergence. If on the 
contrary a > 1 , then g' 
every w > w', we have 



contrary >!, then g' = ^ }> 0, and m' may be so determined that, for 

2 



And since this value a is >> 1, theorem 1 proves the divergence. The proof 
in the case of the ratio is quite analogous. 

If a=l, these two theorems prove nothing. 

3. The reasoning just applied in 2. is obviously also legitimate when 

llm "y/a n or lim -^^ is < 1, in the one case, and lira ya n or lim --^^ is > 1, 
a n a n 

in the other. If one of these upper or lower limits is =1, or the upper limit 
> 1, the lower < 1, then we can infer almost nothing as to the convergence or diver- 
gence of Z a n . The supplementary note to 75, 1, however, shows that, in the root 

test, it is sufficient for divergence 10 that "lim ^/a n > 1. 

4. The remarks just made in 2. and 3. are so obvious that, in similar 
cases in future, we shall not specially mention them. 

5. The root and ratio tests are by far the most important tests used in 
practice. For most of the series which occur in applications, the question of 
convergence or divergence can be solved by their means. We append a few 
examples, in which x, for the present, represents a positive number. 

a) 2n a x n (a arbitrary). 
Here we have 

?st_(!Ll)., .*,, 

a n \ n J f 

as !Lzt__ = 1 ^ --- * 1 and is permanently positive (v. 38, 8). The series is 
n n 

therefore and this without reference to the value of a convergent if 
*< 1, divergent if x> 1. For x = 1 our two tests are inconclusive; however 
we then get the harmonic series, with which we are already acquainted.

13. The root test and the ratio test. 119 

Hence this series too is convergent for x < 1, divergent for x > 1, whatever be 
the value of p. For x = 1 and p ^ it obviously diverges, since then w -- 1 ^ 1 for 
every n. In the case of convergence we shall later on find for its sum the value

11 In this series, summation may only begin with n = 2, since log 1 0. 
Such and similar obvious restrictions we shall in future not always expressly men- 
tion; it suffices, for the question of convergence or divergence, that the indicated 
terms of the series, from some place onwards, have determinate values. In all 
that follows, as already agreed on p. 83, the sign "log" will always stand for the 
natural logarithm, i. e. that to the base e (46 a).

onwards, so that the generic term of the series is >> . 



14. Series of positive, monotone decreasing terms. 

Before passing from these quite elementary considerations, we 
will mention a particularly simple class of series of positive terms, 
namely those series whose terms a n , at least from some place 
onwards, form a monotone sequence. To this class belong nearly all 
the series given as examples above and also the majority of those 
which occur in applications. For such series we have the following: 

00 

77. Cauchy's theorem of convergence 12 . // a n is a series whose 

n=i 

terms form a positive monotone decreasing sequence (a n \ then it con- 
verges and diverges with 

^2 fc a 9 k^a JL + 2a a + 4 4 -f Sa s + 
*=o 

Preliminary remark. What is particularly remarkable in this theorem 
is that it shows that a small proportion of all the terms of the series suffices 
to determine the convergence or divergence of the whole series. For this 
reason it is also called the condensation theorem. 

It shows that the harmonic series J5J , for instance, is certainly diver- 
gent, for it converges and diverges with the series 



which is unmistakably divergent. And speaking generally, the series is 

n a 
inferred to converge and diverge with the series 

t* 



but this is a geometric series and therefore converges or diverges according 
as a ;> 1 or a < 1 . 

These examples also show us that the convergence or divergence of 

22 fl 8 ft is often more easily ascertained than that of the series 2 a n itself; 
it is just in this that the value of the theorem lies. 

Proof. We denote the partial sums of the given series by s n , 
those of the new series by t k . Then we have (cf. 74, 2) 



12 Analyse algbrique, p. 135. 



14. Series of positive, monotone decreasing terms. 121 

a) for n < 2 k 



i. e. 



b) for n > 2 



. e. 



Inequality a) shows that the sequence (s w ) is bounded if the sequence (t^ 
is bounded; inequality b), conversely, that if (s n ) is bounded, so is (t k ). 
The two sequences are therefore either both bounded or both un- 
bounded, and therefore the two series under consideration either both 
converge or both diverge, q. e. d. 

Before given further examples illustrating this theorem, we may 
extend it somewhat 13 ; for it is immediately evident that the number 2 
plays no essential part in the theorem. In fact we have, more 
generally, the 

Theorem. // Sa n is again a series whose terms form a positive 78. 
monotone decreasing sequence (aj, and if (g , g lf . ..) is any monotone 
increasing sequence of integers, then the two series 

CO 00 

n=0 n *=0 k ff k 

are either both convergent or both divergent, provided g k , for every 
k > , fulfils the conditions 

grc > gfc-i ^ and &+! Sic^ M ' fefc ~ &c-i) 
in the second of which M stands for a positive constant. 

Proof. Exactly as before we have

preceding a ffo (or otherwise 0), 

^ A + (g go) a Qo -f- + (fifc+i 6W a g k > 
i. e. 



18 Schlomilch. O.: Zeitschr. f. Math. u. Phys., Vol. 18, p. 425. 1873. 

14 The second condition signifies that the gaps in the sequence (&), re- 
latively to the sequence of all positive integers, must not increase at too 
great a rate.

And from the two inequalities the statements in question follow in 
the same way as before. 

79* Remarks. 

1. It suffices of course that the conditions in either theorem be fulfilled 
from and after a definite place in the series. Therefore we may, in the extended 
theorem, suppose, as a particular case, 

ft _8*. =4*,..., or =[g*] 

where g is any real number >> 1 and [g H ] the largest integer not greater 
than g*. We also satisfy the requirements of this theorem by taking 

& = **, =*', =*,... . 

00 

With gfrssh* we obtain, for instance, the theorem that the series 22 a m >f 

n=o 
(a n ) is a positive monotone decreasing sequence, converges and diverges with 

+ 7a tf -f 



We may also replace this last series, according to 70, 4, by the series 



2. J^ 7 : - is divergent, although its terms are materially less than 

those of the harmonic series; for according to our theorem, this series con- 
verges and diverges with 



and is therefore, by 70, 2, like the harmonic series, divergent. The divergence 
of this series and of those considered in the next examples was first discovered 
by N. H. Abel 16 (v. CEuvres II, p. 200).

way), died April 6 th , 1829, at the Froland ironworks, near Arendal.

and this, since log 2 < 1 , has larger terms than Abel's series 5? - discussed 

k log k 
above, and must therefore diverge. 

4. Thus we may continue as long as we please. To abbreviate, let us 
denote by log r x the yP le repeated or iterated logarithm of a positive number x, 
so that 

Iog x = x > Io i = log , log a x = log (log x), ... 
log r x = log (log,..! x) . 



We may also take log_ t x to denote the value e x '. 

These iterated logarithms only have a meaning if x is sufficiently large; 
thus loga; only for a;>0, Iog 2 x only for sc>l, Iog 3 x only for x>e, and 
so on; and we shall only place them in the denominators of the terms of our 
series if they are positive, i. e. log x only for x> 1, log a x only for x>e, 
Iog 8 a; onlv * or x > e * > and so on - H therefore we wish to consider the series 



og*... log, n 

then the summation must only begin with a suitably large index, whose 
exact value, however, (by 7O, 1), does not matter. Since the logarithms increase 
monotonely with w, and the terms therefore decrease monotonely, the series, 
by Caucfry's theorem, converges and diverges with 

^ 1 



and this, since 2 <e t must certainly diverge, if 



_ 

k log k . . . log^ x k 

diverges. Since the divergence of the latter series was proved for p = 1 (and 
= 2), it follows by Mathematical Induction (2, V) that it diverges for 
every p>l. 

5. The series above considered, however, become convergent if we raise 

the last factor in the denominator to a power > 1. That converges for 

n a 



1 , we already know. If we assume proved for a particular (integer) p > 1,

As 3>, this series has its terms less than those of the series (*) (assumed 
convergent), if the terms of the latter are multiplied by 2 (which by 70, 2 
leaves the convergence undisturbed). 

The series brought forward in the two last examples will later on render 
us most valuable services as comparison series. 

We will prove one more remarkable theorem on series of positive 
monotone decreasing terms, although it anticipates to a certain extent 
the general considerations on convergence of the following chapter 
(v. 82, Theorem 1). 

80. +j Theorem. // the series 2 a n of positive monotone decreasing terms 
is to converge, then we must have not only a n > 0, but 17 

n a n -* . 

Proof. By hypothesis, the sequence of partial sums a -f- a \ ~H 
-J- a n = s n is convergent. Having chosen e > 0, we can therefore so 
choose m that for every v > m and every i ^> 1 we have 

| s v+;i s v | < -* , 
i. e. 



If we now choose n > 2m, then, taking v = [^n], the largest integer 
not greater than n, we have v^m and therefore 

flv+i + a v+2 H ----- h < y; 
a fortiori, therefore, 

(n -)*< ~ 
and 



Therefore na n +Q, q. e. d. 

Remark. We must expressly emphasize the fact that the condition 
n a n > is only a necessary t not a sufficient one for the convergence of our 
present type of series, i. e. if n a n does not tend to 0, then the series in question 
is certainly divergent 18 , while n a n * does not necessarily imply anything 
as to the possible convergence of the series. In point of fact, the Abel's series 

^ - - diverges, although it has monotone decreasing terms and

00 

An infinite scries a n , whose terms are now no longer assumed 

n=0 

subjected to any restriction, but may be arbitrary real numbers, 
was, we agreed, to be considered as essentially a new symbol for 
the sequence (s n ) of its partial sums 

s n = *o + *i H ----- 1- a n (n = , 1 , 2 , . . .) 

and we proposed to transfer immediately to the series itself the de- 
signations introduced to characterise the convergence or divergence 
of (s n ). The case of convergence again occupies our main attention. 
The second main criterion (47 51), expressing the necessary and 
sufficient condition for convergence, at once provides the following 
81. Fundamental theorem (First form). The necessary and sufficient 
condition for the convergence of the series 2 a n ts ^at, having chosen 
any e > , we can assign a number n Q = w (e) such that for every 
n > n {} and every k ^> 1 , we have 



that is to say, in the present case, that

Starting with the second form of the main criterion, we also ob- 
tain for the present fundamental theorem the following 

Second form. The series 2 a n converges if, and only if, given 81 a, 
a perfectly arbitrary sequence (k n ) of positive integers, the sequence 
of numbers 

T n =(n n+l + ff w+4 H ----- f- r&M+* n ) 



invariably proves to be a null sequence 1 . And as before we can 
extend this somewhat to the

which the first , at least , tends to + oo , the sequence of numbers

R em arks. 

1. A series represents essentially a new symbolic expression for se- 
quences of numbers, and in particular, as we remarked, not only every series 
represents a sequence, but every sequence is also expressible as a series; all 
remarks and examples given on p. 84 have their parallels here. 

2. The contents of the fundamental theorem may bo formulated as follows: 
Given e ^> , every portion of the series, however long, provided only its initial 
index be sufficiently large, must have a sum whose absolute value is <* 
Or: Given f>> 0, we must be able to assign an index m so that for n^>m the 
addition, to s n , of an arbitrary number of terms immediately consecutive to a n can 
only alter this partial sum by less than e. 

3. Our present theorems and remarks of course also hold for series of 
positive terms This the reader should verify in each separate case. 

A finite part of the series, such as 

4- 0K+a H ----- h #*+;i 



we may for brevity call a pot tion of the series, denoting it by T v if it 
begins immediately after the y th term. When required, we may further ex- 
plicitly indicate the number of terms in the portion by denoting this by 
Ty t i. If we are considering an arbitrary sequence of such portions 
whose initial index * + > we shall refer to it for short as a "se- 
qnence of portions" of the given series. The second and third form 
of the fundamental theorem may then also be expressed thus: 

4 th form. The series a n converges if, and only if, every 81 c. 
"sequence of portions" of the series is a null sequence. 



1 It is substantially in this form that N. H. Abel establishes the criterion 
in his fundamental memoir on the Binomial series (Journ f. die reine u. angew. 
Math., Vol. 1, p. 311. 1826).

1. Sa n is thus divergent if, and only if at least one sequence of portions 
can be assigned which is not a null sequence. For the harmonic series

converges. 

3. For the sequence 



n=l 
we have 

T M = T n . t = (- ] 



Whether k is even or odd, the expression m brackets is certainly positive and 

< r . For if we take together, in pairs, each positive term and the follow- 
n -+ 1 

ing negative term, the sum of the two K in each case positive. If k *s even 
all terms are exhausted in this manner, if k is uneven a positive term remains, 
so that in either case the complete expression is seen to be positive. If, on 
the other hand, we write it in the form 



__ __ ___ - __ 

n+l \n + 2 w + 3/ Vn + 4 n + 5 
all the terms are now exhausted when k is odd and a negative term remains 

over if k is even, so that in both cases only subtractions from - - occur, 

n -{- 1 

and thus the expression is < - - . As we now have 

n+ I 



1 " ' ' "'"'^n+1 
this involves 

and our series converges. We shall see later (cf. 120) that its sum coincides 
with the limit of the sequence 46, 2 and has the value log 2. 



15. The second principal criterion and the algebra of convergent series. 129 

To these four separate forms of the second fundamental criterion we 
may at once attach the following simple but important considerations: 

Since in the second form, by putting ft w = l, we obtain 
a n+1 *0, we have also (by 27, 4), a n *0, i. e. we have the 

Theorem 1. In a convergent series, the terms a n necessarily form 82, 
a null sequence: a n -> 0. 

That this condition is not sufficient for convergence, we know 
already, from the example of the harmonic series. 

If, on the other hand, we already know that a n converges, 

CO 

then so does the series a M + 1 + n + a + n+3 + =2? a v> whose 

r-n + l 

sum is usually, as the so called remainder of the series a n > 
denoted by r n (so that $ n -\- r n = s = the sum of the complete 
series). Now we may, in the inequality 



valid for n > n and every k I> 1 , allow k to increase beyond all bounds 
and so obtain, for every n > n , r n <^ e . Thus we have the 

CO 

Theorem 2\ The remainders r n = a v of a convergent series 

r=n + l 

J a n = s , i. e. the numbers 



n 
n=o 



always form a null sequence. 

In 80, we saw further that if the terms of a convergent series 
a n (of positive terms) are monotone decreasing, then, over and 
above the theorem just proved, the condition n a n > must hold. 
That this need no longer be the case in series of arbitrary terms is 
already shewn by the series given in 81 c, 3. We can, however, show 
that we must have 

<i + 2 gg H ----- h n a n ^ 
n 

i. e. that the terms of the sequence (n n ) are small on the average. 
In fact we have 2 the more general 

00 

Theorem 3. // a n t5 a convergent series of arbitrary terms 

n=0 

and if (p , p l9 ...) denotes an arbitrary monotone increasing se- 
quence of positive numbers tending to + oo , then the ratio 

A a l + + Ai a n ^ Q 



2 L. Kronecker, Comptes rendus de 1'Ac. de Paris, Vol. 103, p. 980. 1886. 
Moreover, this condition is not only necessary, but also, in a quite determinate 
sense, sufficient, for the convergence of the series 27 a n (cf. Ex. 58 a). 



130 Chapter IV. Series of arbitrary terms. 

Proof. By 44, 2, s n *s implies 

a l *0 + (P* - &) S l 4- - ' + (ft. -/>-,) *n-i 


Since--- *0 and s n s, we must therefore have 

rn 



W Pn 

But this is precisely the relation we had to prove, as may be seen 
at once by reducing to the common denominator p n and grouping in 
succession the terms which contain P 9p l >->p n respectively 3 . 

As regards any condition for convergence whatsoever, we have 
to repeat expressly that the stipulations made therein always concern 
or only need concern those terms of the series which follow 
on some determinate one, whose index may moreover be replaced 
by any larger index. In deciding whether a series is or is not con- 
vergent, the beginning of the series, as it is usually put for brev- 
ity, does not come into account. This we express more exactly 
in the following 

00 

Theorem 4. // we deduce , from a given series 2 a n > a new 

00 

series a n ' by omitting a finite number of terms, prefixing a finite

number of terms, or altering a finite number of terms (or doing 

all three things at once] and now designating afresh the terms of the 

series so produced by # ', a/, ..., 4 then either both series converge 
or both diverge. 

Proof. The hypotheses imply that a definite integer q = Q exists 
such that from some place onwards, say for every n > m , we have 



Every portion of the one series is therefore also a portion of 
the other, provided only its initial index be > m -j- | ? | The fun- 
damental theorem Sid. immediately proves the correctness of our 
statement. 



8 Instead of the positive p n we may (cf. 44, 3 and 5) take any se- 
quence (f n ) , for which, on the one hand, | p n \ * -f- oo and, on the other, a 
constant K is assignable for which

15. The second principal criterion and the algebra of convergent series. 131 

Remark. 

It should be expressly noted that for series of arbitrary terms, compari- 
son tests of every kind become entirely powerless. In particular, of two series 
2 a n and 2 a n f whose terms are asymptotically equal (a n ~ a n f ) , the one may 

f _ ]\n 

quite well converge and the other diverge. Take for instance a n = -- 

ft 

and aJ = a n -\ -- : - . 
* n nlogn 

Finally we prove the following criterion of convergence, which 
appears almost unique in consequence of its particularly elementary 
character, and relates to the so-called alternating series, i. e. to series 
whose terms have alternately positive and negative signs: 

Theorem 5. [Leibniz's rule 5 .] An alternating series, for which 
the absolute values of the terms form a monotone null sequence, 
is invariably convergent. 

The proof proceeds on quite similar lines to that of 81 C, 3. 
For if a n is the given alternating series, then a n has cither the 
sign ( l) n , for every n, or the sign ( l) n+1 , for every n. If we 
write, therefore, | a n \ cc n , we have 

T n = T n>k = [ B + 1 - n+9 -h cc n+3 -+ + (- I)*- 1 n + J - 



As the a's are monotone decreasing, we may convince ourselves 
precisely as in the example referred to, that the value of the square 
bracket is always positive, but less than its first term a n+1 . Thus 

\T n \ = [7^1 < w + 1 , 

which, since cc n forms a null sequence by hypothesis, involves T n * 
and therefore convergence of a n , by 81 C. 

The algebra of convergent series. 

Already in 69, 2, 3, it has been emphasized that the term "sum", 
to designate the limit of the sequence of partial sums of a series, 
is misleading in so far as it arouses a belief that an infinite series 
may be operated on by the same rules as an (actual) sum of a definite 
number of terms, e. g. of the form (a + b + c + d) > Sa 7- This is not 
the case, however, and the presumption is therefore fundamentally 
erroneous, although some of the rules in question do actually remain 
valid for infinite series. The principal laws in the algebra of (actual) 
sums are (according to 2, I and III) the associative, distributive and 
commutative laws. The following theorems arc intended to show how 
far these laws remain true for infinite series.

unrestrictedly in the following sense only: 

a o + a i + *3 H ---- = s 

implies 

K + a i -\ ----- h rt n) + fa^+i + 0^+2 -I ----- h -f ---- = s, 

if T>J , r a , . . . denote any increasing sequence of different integers and 
the sum of the terms enclosed in each bracket is considered as one 
term of a new series 



where, therefore, for k = , 1, 2, ...,

Proof. The succession of partial sums S^ of 2 A k is ob- 
viously the sub-sequence s ri , s r , f ..., s r , ... of the sequence of partial 
sums s n of 2a n . By 41, 4, 5 M therefore tends to the same limit as s n .

2. That we may introduce brackets, but may not without consideration omit 
brackets occurring m a series, the following simple example shows: The series

where (1 1) for 0, we obtain the correct equality 



(1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + . . . = 2(1 - 1) - 0. 
But by omitting the brackets we obtain the divergent series 
1_ 1 + 1 _ 1 + _...,

which therefore may not be put "= 0". For we should then by again grouping 
the terms, though in a slightly different way, obtain 

1 (1 1) (1 - 1) ... s 1 _ - - . . . , 

which again converges and has the sum 1. We should therefore finally deduce that

We proceed at once to complete Theorem 1 by the following 

CO 

Theorem 2. If the terms of a convergent infinite series 2 A k are

In fact in that case, by the preceding theorem, Z a n 2 A k , while in 
the case of divergence of 27 a n , this equality would become meaningless. 

A usually sufficient indication as to whether the new series converges 
is provided by the following 

Supplementary theorem. The new series Ea n deduced from H A k 
in accordance with the preceding theorem is certainly convergent if the quantities 



form a null sequence 7 .

we have 



and choose m% so large that, for every k > m 2 , we have A k ' < ?. If m

is larger than both these numbers m l and m z , then we have, for every 



8 In former times before the strict foundation of the algebra of infinite 
series (v. Introduction) mathematicians found themselves fairly at a loss when 
confronted with paradoxes such as this. And even though the better mathematicians 
instinctively avoided arguments such as the above, the lesser brains had all the 
more opportunity of indulging in the boldest speculations. Thus e. g. Guido 
Grandi (according to R. Reiff, v. 69, 8) believed that in the above erroneous train 
of argument which turns into 1, he had obtained a mathematical proof of the 
possibility of the creation of the world from nothing ! 

7 As A k - 0, this is of itself the case if the terms which constitute A k have 
one and the same sign in particular, therefore, if by omission of the brackets 
we obtain a series of positive terms. Furthermore, this is always the case if the terms 
a n form a null sequence and if the number v k +i v k of terms grouped together in 
A k forms a bounded sequence for A 0, 1, 2, . . . (An example is afforded by the 
series 2(a n -f- b n ) in the next Theorem 3.)

15. The second principal criterion and the algebra of convergent series. 135 

Proof. If s n and t n are the partial sums oj the first two 
series, then (s n + O are those of the third. By 41, 9, it therefore 
follows at once that (s n -f- n ) - * s + t. That the brackets may be 
omitted, in the series thereby proved convergent, follows from the 
supplementary theorem of Theorem 2, since (|0 n |) and (|& n |) and 
therefore also (| a n \ + | b n |) are null sequences. 

Theorem 4. Convergent series may in the same sense be sub- 
tracted term by term. The proof is identical. 

Theorem 5. Convergent series may be multiplied by a constant, 
that is to say, from 2a n = s it follows, if c is an arbitrary number , that 



Proof. The partial sums of the new series are cs n , if those 
of the old are s n . Theorem 41, 10 at once proves the statement. 
This theorem, to some extent, provides the extension to infinite series 
of the distributive law. 

Remarks and Examples. 84. 

1. These simple theorems are all the more important, as they not only allow 
us to deduce the convergence of the new series from the convergence of known series, 
but also set up a relation between its sum and that of the known series. They form 
therefore the foundation for actual calculation in terms of infinite series.

or more precisely: we obtain the convergence of the series on the left hand side 
and the value ot its sum, the latter expressed in terms of the sum of the 
series from which we started. The convergence was also proved directly in 
connection with theorem 2; the present considerations have led however appre- 
ciably further, since they afford a definite statement as to the sum of the series. 

Before we examine the validity of the commutative and distributive 
laws and investigate, in relation to the latter, the possibility of forming 
the product of two series, we still require an important preliminary.

16. Absolute convergence. Derangement of series. 

The series 1 -3 + | 3- + proved (81 c, 3) to be convergent* 
But if we replace each term by its absolute value, the series becomes 
the divergent harmonic series 1 + | + | + In all that follows, it 
will usually make a very material difference whether a convergent 
series 2 a n remains convergent or becomes divergent, when all its 
terms are replaced by their absolute values. Here we have, to begin 
with, the

the left hand side is here certainly < e if the right hand side is, 
whence by the fundamental theorem 81 our first statement at once 
follows. Since further 



we have also, by 41, 2, | s | < S. 

By this theorem, all convergent series are divided into two classes 
and 2a n belongs to the one or the other according as -2"|fl,J is or 
is not also convergent. We define 

86. Definition. If a convergent series Ea n is such that Z\ a n \ also 
converges, then the first series will be called absolutely convergent, and other- 

wise non-absolutely convergent 9 . 

Examples. 
The series 

( ^ ; 5l^t2?. (>!); 

-l n w-1 n =0 



are absolutely convergent. Every convergent series of positive terms is of course 
absolutely convergent. 

The very great significance of the concept of absolute convergence 
will first appear in this : the convergence of absolutely convergent series 
is much more easy to recognise than that of non-absolutely convergent 
series, usually, in fact, by comparison with series of positive terms, 



8 Cauchy, Analyse alggbrique, p. 142. (The proof is inadequate.) On 
the other hand, the example just given showed that the convergence of 2a n 
need not involve that of 2\a n \.

not absolutely. The designation "non-absolutely convergent" applies therefore 
to convergent series only.

so that the simple and far-reaching theorems of the preceding chapter 
become available for the purpose. But this significance will imme- 
diately become further visible in that we may operate on absolutely 
convergent series, on the whole, precisely as we operate on (actual) sums 
of a definite number of terms, whereas in the case of non-absolutely 
convergent series this is in general no longer the case. The following 
theorems will show this in detail. 

Theorem 1. // 2c n is a convergent series of positive terms and 87. 
if the terms of -a given series 2 ' a n , for every n > m, satisfy the condition 

I a n I ^ c n or ^0 condition 

then 2a n is (absolutely) convergent. 

Proof. By the 1 st and 2 nd comparison tests, 72 and 73, respec- 
tively, | a n | is in either case convergent 11 , and so therefore, by 85, 
is 2 a n . 

In consequence of this simple theorem the complete store of con- 
vergence tests relating to series of positive terms becomes available 
for series of arbitrary terms. We infer at once from it the following 

Theorem 2. // Za n is an absolutely convergent series and if 
the factors a n form a bounded sequence, then the series 



is also (absolutely) convergent. 

Proof. Since (|# n |) is a bounded sequence simultaneously with 
(aj, it follows from 70,2 that 2*| a n |-| a n | = 2*| # n a n | is convergent 
simultaneously with 2 \ a n \ . 

Examples. 

1. If 2 c n is any convergent series of positive terms and if the c^, 's are 
bounded, then 2 ct n c n is also convergent, for then 2 c n is also absolutely con- 
vergent. We may thus, for instance, instead of joining the terms c t *!>*> 
with the invariable sign +, replace this by quite arbitrary + .and signs, 
in every case we get a convergent series; for the factors ^ 1 certainly form 
a bounded sequence. Thus for instance the series 



a , 



S(-V)c a 

are all convergent, where [z], as usual, stands for the largest integer not 
greater than z. 



10 In the second condition, it is tacitly assumed that, for every n>m, 
a n 4= and c n =(= 0. 

11 The corresponding criteria of divergence, 

dm 



and 



are of course abolished, since the divergence of J?| a n |, not necessarily of 
is all that follows. Cf. Footnote 8. 



138 Chapter IV. Series of arbitrary terms. 

2. If Sa n is absolutely convergent, then the series obtained from it by 
an arbitrary alteration in the signs of its terms, is invariably an absolutely 
convergent series. 

We shall now returning thereby to the questions put aside at 
the end of last section ( 15), show that for absolutely convergent series 
the fundamental laws of the algebra of (actual) sums are in all essen- 
tials maintained, but that for non- absolutely convergent series this is 
no longer the case. 

Thus the commutative law "a-\-b = 6 -f- a" does not in general 
hold for infinite series. The meaning of this statement is as follows: 
If (v Q> v iJ v a , . . .) is any rearrangement (27,3) of the sequence (0,1, 
2, . . .) then the series 

!;<*' = j>j a v (i. e. with a n ' = a v for n = 0, 1, 2, . . .) 

n =0 n=0 w n 

00 

will be said, for brevity, to result from the given series a n by 

=o 

rearrangement or derangement of the latter. The value of (actual) 
sums ot a definite number of terms remains unaltered, however the 
terms may be rearranged (permuted). For infinite series this is no 
longer the case 1 *. This is shown already by the two series considered 
as examples in 81 c, 3 and 83 Theorems 1 and 2, namely 



which are evidently rearrangements of one another, but have different 
sums. The sum of the first was in fact s < j, while that of the second 
was s'>^; and indeed the considerations of 84, 2 showed more 
precisely that s' = f s. 

This circumstance of course enforces the greatest care in working 
with infinite series, since we must to put it shortly take account 
of the oider of the terms 18 . It is therefore all the more valuable to 
know in which cases we may not need to be so careful, and for this 
we have the 

88. Theorem 1. For absolutely convergent series , the commutative law 

holds unrestrictedly 1 *. 

Proof. Let Z a n be any absolutely convergent series (i. e. Z \ a n \ 
is convergent as well), and let Z a n ' =27 a v be a derangement of Z a n . 



M Thib was first remarked by Cauchy (Resume's analytiques, Turin 1833). 

18 As 2 a n merely represents the sequence (s n ) t and a rearrangement of 
Za n produces a series 2 a n ' with entirely different partial sums s n ', these 
not merely forming a rearrangement of (s n ), but representing entirely diffe- 
rent numbers!! it seems a priori most improbable that such a derangement 
will be without effect on the behaviour of the series. 

14 Lejeune-Dinchlet, G.: Abh. Akad Berlin 1837, p. 48 (Werke I, p. 319). 
Here we also find the example given in the text, of the alteration in the sum 
of the series by derangement. 



16. Absolute convergence. Derangement of series. 139 

Then every bound for the partial sums of S \ a n \ is clearly also a bound 
for the partial sums of 27 1 a n ' |. So Z a n ' is absolutely convergent with 
S a n . Let s n denote the partial sums of 2 a n , and s n ' those of S a n '. Then 
if e is arbitrarily given > 0, we may first choose m, in accordance with 
81, so large, that for every k ^ 1 

I + I m+ 2 1 + + | a m+k I < e 



and now choose n Q so large that the numbers v , v l9 v 2 , . . . , v n comprise 15 
at least all the numbers 0, 1, 2, . . . , m. Then the terms a , a lf a z , > 
a m evidently cancel in the difference s n ' s n , for every n > w , and only 
terms of index > m remain, that is, only (a finite number of the) terms 
a m\-i> a m\2> Since, however, the sum of the absolute values of any 
number of these terms is always < e, we have, for every n > n Q , 



and therefore (s n r s n ) is a ' null sequence. But this implies that 
s n = s n + ( s n ~ s n) nas tne same limit as s n , i. e. a n ' is convergent 
and has the same sum as 2 a n , q. c. d. 

This property of absolutely convergent series is so essential that it 
deserves a special designation: 

Definition. A convergent infinite series which obeys the commutation 89. 
law without any restriction , i. e. remains convergent, with unaltered sum, 
under every rearrangement, shall be called unconditionally conver- 
gent. A convergent series, on the other hand, whose behaviour as to con- 
vergence can be altered by rearrangement, for which therefore the order of 
the terms must be taken into account, shall be called conditionally con- 
vergent. 

The theorem proved just above can now be expressed as follows: 
''Every absolutely convergent series is unconditionally convergent" 

The converse of this theorem also holds, namely 

Theorem 2. Every non-absolutely convergent series is only condi- 
tionally convergent 16 . In other words, the validity of the equality 

00 

2 = * 

H~0 

in the case of a non-absolutely convergent series Z a n depends essentially 
on the order of the terms of the series on the left, and may therefore, by 
a suitable rearrangement, be disturbed. 



16 That such a number n Q exists follows from the very definition of derange- 
ment. 

16 Cf. Fundamental theorem of 44. 



140 Chapter IV. Series of arbitrary terms. 

Proof. It obviously suffices to prove that, by a suitable rearrange- 
ment, we can deduce from 2 a n a divergent series 2 a n '. This we may 
do as follows: The terms of the series 2 a n which are ^ 0, we denote, 
in the order in which they occur in 2 a n , by p l9 p 2> p& . . . ; those which 
are < we denote similarly by q l9 <? 2 , q 3 , . . . Then 2 p n and 
2 q n are series of positive terms. Of these, one at least must diverge. For 
if both were convergent, with sums P and Q say, then we should obviously 
have, for each n, 



hence 2 a n would, by 70, be absolutely convergent, in contradiction with 
our assumption 17 . If for instance 2 p n diverges, then we consider a series 
of the form 

Pi +P2 + + Am 01 + Ai+l + Am+2 + + Pm* ft + A.+l + > 

in which, therefore, we have alternately a group of positive terms fol- 
lowed by a single negative term. This series is clearly a rearrangement 
of the given series 2 a n and will, as such, be denoted by 2 a n '. Now since 
the series 2p n was assumed to diverge, and its partial sums are therefore 
unbounded, we can, in the above, first choose m so large that p -f p 2 + 
+ Pm L >l + ?i> tncn m z > m i so large that 

Pi+P* "!- + Am + - +p m > > 2 + ?i + ft 
and, generally, w,, > #*_! so large that 

+ Pm v > v + q l + ft + . . . + q 



(y = 3, 4, . . .). But 2 a n ' is then clearly divergent; for each of those partial 
sums of this series whose last term is a negative term q v of 2 a n , is by 
the above > v (v = 1, 2, . . .). And since v may stand for every positive 
integer, the partial sums of 2 a n ' are certainly not bounded, and 2 a n ' 
itself is divergent, q. e. d. 18 . 

If 2 q n is divergent, we need only interchange 2p n and 2 q n suitably 
in the above to reach the same conclusion. 



17 It is not difficult to see that actually both the series Sp n and q n must 
diverge (cf. 44); but this is for the moment superfluous. 

18 E a n ' clearly diverges to + 00.

For the partial sums of this series terminating with the v th negative term is greater 
than 2 v minus v proper fractions, i. e. certainly > v. 

Theorem 88, 1 on the derangement of absolutely convergent series 
may still be considerably extended. For the purpose, we first prove the 
following simple 

Theorem 3. If H a n is absolutely convergent, then every "sub-series" 
Sa\ n for which the indices A n denote, therefore, any monotone increasing 
sequence of different positive integers, is again convergent and in fact again 
absolutely convergent. 

Proof. By 74, 4, 27 1 a Xfl \ converges with E (a n ). By 85, the state- 
ment at once follows. 

We may now extend the rearrangement theorem 88, 1 in the fol- 
lowing manner. We begin by picking out a first sub-series 27 a\ n of the 
given absolutely convergent series 27 a n , and arranging this first sub-series 
in any order, denote it by 



let # (0 > be the sum of this series, certainly existing, by the preceding theorem, 
and independent of the chosen arrangement by 88, 1 19 . We may also 
allow this and the following sub-series to consist of only a finite number 
of terms, i. e. not to be an infinite series at all. From the remaining 



19 The letter z is intended as a reference to the rows of the following doubly 
infinite array. 



142 Chapter IV. Series of arbitrary terms. 

terms as far as is possible we again pick out a (finite or infinite) 
sub-series, and denote it, arranged in any order, by 



its sum by # (1) ; from the remaining terms we again pick out a sub-series, 
and so on. In this manner, we obtain, in general, an infinite series of finite 
or (absolutely) convergent infinite series: 



If the process was such as to give each non-zero term 20 of the scries a n 
a place in one (and only one) of these sub-series, then the series 



or, that is to say, the series 



may in a further extended sense be called a rearrangement of the given 
series 21 . For this again we have, corresponding to theorem 88, 1 : 

Theorem 4. An absolutely convergent series "may" also in the ex- 
tended sense be rearranged. More precisely: The series 

* + *d> + *< 2) + 

is again (absolutely) convergent, and its sum is equal to that of a n . 

Proof. If e > be given, first determine m so that, for every k ^ 1 , 
the remainder | a m+1 \ + | a m+2 \ + . . . < e, and then choose n so that 
in the first n Q + I sub-series 2 a n ^\ v = 0, 1, . . . , # , the terms a Q , a ly a 2 , 
. . . , a m of the given series certainly appear. If n > n Q and > m, then 
the series 

. . . + *0> - s n 



20 The introduction or omission of zero terms in 27 a n or in the partial sums 
is obviously without influence on the present considerations. 

21 Put into the first sub-series, besides a and a jt all those terms a nt for in- 
stance, in any order, whose indices n are divisible by 2; into the next all those of 
the remaining terms whose indices are divisible by 3; into the next again all re- 
maining terms whose indices are divisible by 6; and so on, using the prime numbers 
7, 11, 13 ... as divisors. 



16. Absolute convergence. Derangement of series. 143 

contains only terms a n whose indices are > m. Hence, by the choice 
of m, the absolute value of this difference is < e, and tends therefore, 
with increasing , to zero, so that 

lim (*(> + *W + . . . + * (n) ) = lim s n = s = 27 a n . 



n >*) 



Moreover, the convergence of 27 #W which is thus established is also 
absolute, since for each n we have obviously 



The converse of this theorem is, of course, even less valid than 
that of theorem 83, 1, without further consideration. Given, for k - 0, 
1 , 2, . . . , the convergent series 

*<*> = 27* n <*> f 
if the aggregate of terms a n W be arranged in any way as a sequence (cf. 

OC 

53, 4), then 27 a n need not at all converge, even should 27 zW be con- 

k-o 

vergent. To show this is possible we have only to take, for each of the 
series z^ k \ the series 1 1 -|- + + + - . And even if 2 a n con- 
verges, the sum need not be equal to that of 2 zW. 

A general discussion of the question under what circumstances this 
converse of our theorem does hold, belongs to the theory of double series. 
However, we may even here prove the following case, which is a par- 
ticularly important one for applications : 

Main rearrangement theorem 22 . We suppose given an infinite 90. 
number of convergent series

and assume that these series are not only absolutely convergent, but satisfy 
the stricter condition that, if we write 

27| *<*> | = W (* = 0, 1, 2, . . . , fixed), 
=o 

the series 



22 Also called Cauchy's Double Series Theorem. 



144: Chapter IV. Series of arbitrary terms. 

is convergent. Then the terms standing vertically one below the other also 
form (absolutely) convergent series; and if we write 23 



= & ( = 0, 1,2,... .fixed), 

=o 

then ZsW is again absolutely convergent and we have 

= J7*<*>; 



in other words, the two series formed by the sums of the rows and by the sums 
of the columns, respectively, are both absolutely convergent and have the same 
sum. 

The proof is extremely simple: Suppose all the terms in (A) arranged 
anyhow (in accordance with 53, 4) in a simple sequence, and denoted, 
as terms of this sequence, by a , a l9 a 2 , . . . . Then H a n is absolutely con- 
vergent. For every partial sum of 27 \ a n \ , for instance 



must still be ^ o-, since by choosing k so large that the terms a , a l9 a 2 , 
. . . , a m all occur in the k first rows of (A), we certainly have 



i. e. fg a. A different arrangement of the terms a n W in (A) as a simple 
sequence a ', a^, a%, . . . would produce a series 2 a n ' which would be 
a mere rearrangement of 2 a n , and therefore again absolutely convergent, 
with the same sum. Let this invariable sum be denoted by s. 

Now both 2zW and also 2sW are rearrangements of a n = s, 
in the extended sense of theorem 4, just proved. Therefore these two 
series are both absolutely convergent and have the same sum s, q. e. d. 

This rearrangement theorem may be expressed in somewhat more 
general form as follows: 

Supplementary theorem. If M is a countable set of numbers 
and there exists a constant K such that the sum of the absolute values 
of any finite number of the elements of M remains invariably < K, 



23 Here the letter s is intended as a reference to the columns of (A). 



16. Absolute convergence. Derangement of series. 



145 



then we can assert the absolute convergence with the invariable 
sum s of every series 2 A k whose terms A k represent sums of a 
finite or infinite number of elements of M (provided each element 
of M occurs in one and only one of the terms A 1( ). And this remains 
true if we allow a repetition of the elements of M, provided each ele- 
ment occurs exactly the same number of times in all the A k 's taken 
together, as in M itself**. 

Examples of these important theorems will occur at several crucial 
points in what follows. Here we may give one or two obvious applications: 
1. Let 2a n =s be an absolutely convergent series and put 

t _+4a_ a + ... + 2 "a M = a/ (w = 0, 1, 2, . . .) 



Then we also have 2a n ' = s. The proof results immediately, by the previous 
rearrangement theorem, from the consideration of the array

the array

8. The preceding rearrangement theorem evidently holds whenever every 
***** is S ^ and at least one ^ tlie two series 2zW and ^s("> converges; 
it holds further whenever it is possible to construct a second array (A') similar 
to (A), whose terms are positive and > the absolute values of the corresponding 
terms in (A), and such that, in (A'), either the sums of the rows or the sums 
of the columns form convergent series. 



24 An infinite number of repetitions of a term different from zero is ex- 
cluded from the outset, since otherwise the constant K of the theorem would 
certainly not exist. And the number can produce no disturbance. 



146 Chapter IV. Series of arbitrary terms. 

17. Multiplication of infinite series. 

We finally enquire to what extent the distributive law "a (b -f- c) 
= a b + c" holds for infinite series. That a convergent infinite series 
2a n may be multiplied term by term by a constant, we have already 
seen in 83, 5. In the simplest form 



the distributive law is therefore valid for all convergent series. In the 
case of actual sums, it at once follows further, from the distributive 
law, that (a-\-fy(c-\-d)=^ac-\-ad -\-bc-\-bd, and more generally, that 

(a + a l +.-- + 
or in short, that 



/i=0 

^<=o, . ..,m 

where the notation on the right is intended to convey that the indices 
A and ju, assume, independently of one another, all the integral values 
from to I and to m respectively, and that all (I -f- 1) (m -f- 1) such 
products a^ b^ are to be added, in any order we please. 

Does this result continue to hold for infinite series? If 2a n ~s 
and 2b n = t are two given convergent infinite series of sum s and t> 
is it possible to multiply out in the product 



(00 v / GO \ 

2*i}-( 2W 
A=0 / \/,=0 / 

in any similar way, and in what sense is this possible? More precisely: 
Let the products 



a* &/i 

be denoted, in any order we choose 25 , by , p^ p 29 . . . ; is the series 
2p n convergent, and if convergent, does it have the sum s t ? Here 
again absolutely convergent series behave like actual sums. In fact we 
have the 

Theorem 26 . If the series Za n = s and Zb n = t are absolutely 
convergent^ then the series Sp n also converges absolutely and has the 
sum s t. 



25 We suppose, for this, that the products a\ b^ are written down exactly in 
the same way as n (t) or aM for 53, 4 and 90, to form a doubly infinite array (A). 
We can then suppose in particular the arrangement by diagonals or the arrangement 
by squares carried out for these products. 

26 Cauchy: Analyse alglbrique, p. 147. 



17. Multiplication of infinite series. 147 

Proof. 1. Let n be a definite integer > and let m be the 
largest of the indices i and JLL of the products a\ b^ which have been 
denoted by p Q , p , ..., p n - Evidently 



i.e. < a r, if (7 and T denote the sums of the series 2, \ a^ \ and J? | & ; < | . 
The partial sums of Jfj^ n | are therefore bounded and 2p n is ab- 
solutely convergent. 

2. The absolute convergence of 2 p n having been proved, we need 
only determine its sum call it S for a special arrangement 
of the products a^ b^, for instance the arrangement "by squares". For 
this we have, however, obviously, 

o b o = Po> K + i)(*o + 6 i) = Po + Pi + P* + PB 
and in general 



an equality which, by 41,10 and 4, becomes, when n *>oo, 



which was the relation to be proved. 

Remarks and Examples. 
1. As remarked, for the validity of the relation 2 p n st under the hypo- 

theses made, it is perfectly indifferent in what manner the products a a b are 

" " 
enumerated, that is to say arranged in order as a simple sequence (p n ). The 

arrangement by diagonals is particularly important in applications, and leads, 
if the products in each diagonal are grouped together (83, 1), to the following 
relation : 



n=0 



n=o 

writing for brevity a b n + &i &_! H- 2 & n-a + + <* n *> = c n . The validity of 
this relation is therefore secured when both series on the left converge ab- 
solutely. 

We are also led to this form or arrangement of the ''product series 11 , 
sometimes called Catichy's product of the two given series 27 , by the conside- 
ration of products of rational integral functions and those of power series, which 
latter will be discussed in the following chapter: If in fact, we form the pro- 
duct of two rational integral functions (polynomials) 

and b -f- 6 X x H- b v x 2 -\ ----- h b m x m

and arrange the result again in order of increasing powers of x, then the first 
terms are 

o b o + ( a o *>i + a i 5 o) * + ( & + a i b i + a &o) * a H ---- 

so that we have the numbers c , c lt c 2 , - , above introduced, appearing as 
coefficients. It is precisely due to this connection that Cauchy*s product of two 
series occurs particularly often.

By our theorem, we have now established that the distributive 
law may at any rate be extended without change to infinite series, 
and this, moreover, with an arbitrary arrangement of the products 
a A bp , if both the two given series are absolutely convergent. It is 
conceivable that this restricting assumption is unnecessarily strict. On 
the other hand, the following example, given already by Cauchy 2 * 
for the purpose, shows that some restriction is necessary, or the theorem 
no longer holds: Let 



so that 2a n and 2b n are convergent in accordance with Leibnitz's 
rule 82, 5. Then c = c == 0, and for n ^> 2,

is certainly divergent in accordance with 82, 1. This is therefore a 
fortiori the case when we omit the brackets. 

Nevertheless, the question remains open, whether we may not 
be able, under less stringent conditions than that of absolute conver- 
gence of both the series 2 a n and 2 b n , to prove the convergence of 
the product series 2 p n at least for some special arrangement of 
the terms a^b^y for instance as in the series 2 c n above. To this 
question we shall return in 45.

is necessary and sufficient for the convergence.

Power series. 

18. The radius of convergence. 

The terms of the series which we have examined so far were, 
for the most part, determinate numbers. In such cases the series 
may be more particularly characterised as having constant terms. This 
however was not everywhere the case. In the geometric series a n , 
for instance, the terms only become determinate when the value of a 
is assigned. Our investigation of the behaviour of this series did not, 
consequently, terminate with a mere statement of convergence or 
divergence, the result was: 2a n converges if\a\ < 1, but diverges 
t/|#|^>l. The solution of the question of convergence or divergence 
thus depends, as do the terms of the series themselves, on the value 
of a quantity left undetermined a variable. Series which have their 
terms, and accordingly their convergence or divergence, depending 
on a variable quantity (such a quantity will usually be denoted by x 



152 Chapter V. Power scries. 

and we shall speak of series of variable terms 1 ) will be investigated 
later in more detail. For the moment we propose only to consider 
series of the above type whose generic term, instead of being a 
number a n , has the form 

*" 

i. e. we shall consider series of the form 2 

+ a,x + a,x* + ... + *" + ... ^ *". 

n^O 

Such series are called power series (in x), and the numbers a n are 
their coefficients. For such power series, we arc thus not concerned 
simply with the alternatives "convergent" or "divergent", but with the 
more precise question: For what values of x is the series convergent, 
and for what values divergent? 

92. Simple examples have already come before us: 

1. The geometric series 2 x n is convergent for |as|<l, divergent for 
| x | ^ 1 . For | x | <1 1, indeed, we have absolute convergence. 

x n 

2. J? - is (absolutely) convergent for every real x; likewise the series 



8. JjjJ , because 



< | a; | n , is absolutely convergent for | a: [ < 1 . 



For | x | > 1 , the series is divergent, because in that case (by 88, 1 and 40), 

x n 

. _j_ oo . For x = 1 it reduces to the divergent harmonic series, and for 



n 



x = 1, to a series convergent by 82, Theorem 5. 

oo y.n 

4. ~~2~on * s (absolutely) convergent for ||^2, but divergent for 



5. X l* n a; n is convergent for # = 0; but for n;^ value of x ^-- it is 

n=l 

divergent, for if x ={= 0, | x \ -+> -f oo and a fortiori \ n* x n \ -* -foo , so that 
(by 82, Theorem 1) there can be no question of the series converging. 

For x = 0, obviously every power series 2a n x n is convergent, 
whatever be the values of the coefficients a n . The general case is 
evidently that in which the power series converges for some values 
of x, and diverges for others, while, in special instances, the two 
extreme cases may occur, in which the series converges for every x 
(Example 2), or for none =|= (Example 5). 



1 The harmonic series ^ ^ is also of this type: it converges for ?> 1, 

diverges for x < 1. 

* We here write, for convenience, x = 1, even when x 0. 



18. The radius of convergence. 153 

In the first of these special cases we say that the power series 
is everywhere convergent, in the second leaving out of account the 
self-evident point of convergence x = we say that it is nowhere 
convergent. In general, the totality of points x for which the given 
series 2a n x n converges is called its region of convergence. 

In 2. this consists therefore of the whole axis of x, in 5. of the 
single point 0; in the other examples, it consists of a stretch bisected 
at the origin, sometimes with, sometimes without one or both of 
its endpoints. 

In this we may see already the behaviour of the series in the 
most general case, for we have the 

Fundamental theorem. If 2a n x n is any power series which 93. 
does not merely converge everywhere or nowhere, then a definite positive 
number r exists such that 2a n x n converges for every \ x \ < r (indeed 
absolutely), but diverges for every \ x \ > r. The number r is called the 
radius of convergence, or for short the radius, and the stretch 

r . . . + r the interval of convergence, of the given power series 3 . 

Fig. 2 schematizes the typical situation established by this theorem. 



dw -r U + r dor. 

Fig 2. 

The proof is based on the following two theorems. 

Theorem 1. // a given power series 2a n x n converges for x = # 
(X Q 4= 0), or even if the sequence (a n x n ) of its terms is only bounded 
there, then 2 a n x n is absolutely convergent for every x = x l nearer 
to the origin than x Q9 i. e. with \x { \ < \X Q \. 

Proof. If | a n x Q n \ < K, say, then 



where # = the proper fraction . By. 87, 1 the result stated follows 

x o 
immediately. 

* Theorem 2. // the given power series 2 a n x n diverges for x = x 
then it diverges a fortiori for every x = x further from the origin 
than x , i. e. with | * | > | * 1 



3 Jn the two extreme cases we may also say that the radius of conver- 
gence of the series is r = or r:=-f-oo, respectively. 



154 Chapter V. Power series. 

Proof. If the series were convergent for x lt then by theorem 1 
it would have to converge for the point a? , nearer than aJ A , 
which contradicts the hypothesis. 

Proof of the fundamental theorem. By hypothesis, there 
exists at least one point of divergence, and one point of convergence 
4= 0. We can therefore choose a positive number X Q nearer than 
the point of convergence and a positive number y further from 
than the point of divergence. By theorems 1 and 2, the series 2 a n x n 
is convergent for x = x Q , divergent for ce = ;y , and therefore we 
certainly have X Q < y . To the interval 7o = ^o !Xo> we a PPty ^ e 
method of successive bisection: we denote by / A the left or the right 
half of 7i according as 2 a n x n diverges or converges at the middle 
point of / . By the same rule, we designate a particular half of 7* 
by 7 a > anc * so on - The intervals of this nest (7 n ) all have the property 
that 2 a n x n converges at their left end point (say x n ) but diverges at 
their right end point (say yj. The number r (necessarily positive), 
which this nest determines, is the number required for the theorem. 

In fact, if x otf is any real number for which | a/ 1 < r (equality 
excluded), then we have | x' \ < x k , for a sufficiently large k, i. e. such 
that the length of J^ is less than r | a/ 1 . By theorem 1, xf is a 
point of convergence at the same time as x k is; and indeed at of we 
have absolute convergence. If, on the contrary, x" is a number for 
which | " | > r, then | x? \ > y tn , provided m is large enough for the 
length of 7 m to be less than | x" \ r . By theorem 2, x? is then a 
point of divergence at the same time as y m is. This proves all that 
was desired. 

This proof, which appeals to the mind by its extreme simplicity, 
is yet not entirely satisfying, in that it merely establishes the existence 
of the radius of convergence without supplying any information as to 
its magnitude. We will therefore prove the fundamental theorem by 
an alternative method, this time obtaining the magnitude of the 
radius itself. For this purpose, we proceed quite independently 
of our previous theorem, to prove the moie precise 
14. Theorem 4 : // the power series 2 a n x n is given and JLI denotes 

the upper limit of the (positive) sequence of numbers

for the time entirely unnoticed, till J. Hadamard (J. de math, pures et appl., (4)

cations.

b) */ p. =r -{- oo, the power series is nowhere convergent;

for every n > m. By 87, 1, this shows that 2 a n x Q n converges ab- 
solutely, which proves a). 

If conversely 2 a n x n converges for x = x^ 4 s 0, then the sequence 

(a n x l n ) and, a fortiori, the sequence \V\a n x^\), are bounded. If 

n . n j 

y\ a n x" | < K 9 say, for every , then V| a n | <C i *-r = /C, for every n> 

L e. \V | a n | J is a bounded sequence. In case b), in which the sequence 
is assumed unbounded above, the series therefore cannot converge for 
any x =fc 0. 

Finally, in case c), if #' is any number for which | d \ < , 

then choose a positive Q for which |o;'| < Q < , and so > p,. By 
the definition of p, we must have, for every n > some n , 

Via I < and consequently I/I atf n \ < < 1.

By 75,1, 2 a n vd n is therefore (absolutely) convergent.

On the other hand, if | x" \ > , so that -^ < ^, then we must 
have, for an infinite number of w's (again and again; v. 59) 



By 82, Theorem 1, therefore the series certainly cannot con- 
verge 6 . 

Thus the theorem is proved in all its parts. 

Remarks and Examples. 

1. Since the three parts a), b), c) of the preceding theorem are mutually 
exclusive, it follows that the conditions are not merely sufficient, but also 
necessary for the corresponding behaviour of a n x n .

2. In particular, we have y | a n \ > for any power series everywhere 

convergent. For by the remark above, ^ = 0, and since we are concerned 
with a sequence of positive numbers, these certainly have their lower limit 
x^>fi. Since on the other hand must be < /* , we must have #=^ = 0. 

By 63 the sequence (|/ | a n \ j is therefore convergent with limit

3. Theorems 93 and 94 give us no information as to the behaviour of 
the series for x= + r and for x = r; this differs from case to case: x tl , 

x n x n 

y. , y\ - all have the radius 1 . The first converges neither at 1 nor at 

n n* 

1 , the second only at one of the two, the third at both. 

4 Further examples of power series will occur continually in the course of 
the next paragraphs, so that we need not indicate any particular examples here. 

We saw that the convergence of a power series in the interior of 
the interval of convergence is, indeed, absolute convergence. We 
proceed to show further that the convergence is so pronounced as to 
be undisturbed by the introduction of decidedly large factors. We have 
in fact the

6 Case c) may be dealt with somewhat more concisely: If 

linTv^l n I = /x, then lim $\ ^T* n ~l - lim V^nl ' I * I =- M ' I * I 
(for what reason?). By 76, 3 the series is therefore absolutely convergent for 
fi | x | < 1, and certainly divergent for /x | x \ > 1, q. e. d. 



18. The radius of convergence. 157 

Proof. This theorem may be immediately inferred from Theo- 
rem 94. For if we write na n = a n ', then 

n - n, n. 

V I ' I = V M -V. 

Since (by 38, 5), ty~n+l> it follows at once from Theorem 62 that

if we pick out the same sub-sequences from both, as corresponding 
terms only differ by the factor y^, which * -)- 1, these sub-sequences 
either both diverge or both converge to the same limit 7 . 

Examples. 

1. By repeated application of the theorem, we deduce that the series 
Sna n x n -*, 2n(n-V)a n x n ~*, ...,2n(n-l) (n k -f- 
or, what is exactly the same thing-, the series 



all have the same radius as 2a n x n , whatever positive integer be chosen 
for h. 

2. The same of course is true of the series 

n 



* +a ? 2> 

Thus far we have only considered power series of the form 
a n x n . These considerations are scarcely altered, if we take the more 
general type 

n=0 

Putting x x = x* , we see that these series converge absolutely foi 

but diverge for | x X Q \ > r , if r again denotes the number deter- 
mined by Theorem 94. The region of convergence of this series 
except in the extreme cases, in which it converges only for 
x = x , or for every x, is therefore a stretch bisected by the 
point # , sometimes with, sometimes without one or both of its end- 
points. Except for this displacement of the interval of convergence, 
all our considerations remain valid. The point # will for brevity be 
called the centre of the series. If X Q = , we have the previous form 
of the series again. 

7 Alternative proof. By 76, 5a or 91, 2, the series 2nd*-* is 
convergent for every | & \ < 1. If | x \ <^ r, and Q is so chosen that 
I #o I "^ 6 "^ r * then 2a n Q n converges, (a n g n ) is therefore bounded, say

which, since 



158 Chapter V. Power series. 

In the interval of convergence, the power series S a n (x x ) n 
has a definite sum $, for each x, and usually of course a different sum 
for a different x. In order to express this dependence on x, we 
write 



and say that the power series defines, in its interval of convergence, a 
function of x. 

The foundations of the theory of real functions, that is to say the 
foundations of the differential and integral calculus, we assume, as remarked 
in the Introduction, to be already known to the reader in all that is essential. 
It is only to avoid any possible uncertainty as to the extent of the facts 
required from these domains, that we shall rapidly indicate, in the fol- 
lowing section, all the definitions and theorems which we shall need, 
without going into more exact elucidations or proofs. 



19. Functions of a real variable. 

Definition 1 (Function). If to each value x of an interval of the 
#-axis, by any prescribed rule, a definite value y is made to correspond, 
then we say that y is a function ofx defined in that interval and write, 
for short, 

y =/(*), 

where "/" symbolises the prescribed rule in virtue of which each x has 
corresponding to it the relevant value of y. 

The interval, which may be closed or open on one or both sides, 
bounded or unbounded, is called the interval of definition of f(x). 

Definition 2 (Boundedness). If there exists a constant K such 
that for every x of the interval of definition we have 



then the function f(x) is said to be bounded on the left (or below) in the 
interval, and K 1 is a bound below (or left hand bound) of /(#). If there exists 
a constant K 2 such that for every x of the interval of definition / (x) ^ K 2 , 
then f(x) is said to be bounded on the right (or above) and K 2 is a bound 
above (or right hand bound) of f(x). A function bounded on both sides is 
said simply to be bounded. There then exists a constant K such that for 
every x of the interval of definition, we have 



19. Functions of a real variable. 159 

Definition 3 (Upper and lower bound, oscillation). There is 
always a least one among all the bounds above of a bounded function, and 
always a greatest among all its bounds below 8 . The former we call the 
upper bound, the latter the lower bound, and their difference the oscillation 
of the function f(x) in its interval of definition. Corresponding desig- 
nations are defined for a sub-interval a' ... V of the interval of definition. 

Definition 4 (Limit of a function). If is a point of the interval 
of definition of a function /(#), or one of the endpoints of that interval, 

then the notation 

= c 



or 

f(x) > c for x -> f 

means that 

a) for every sequence of numbers x n of the interval of definition which 
converges to , but with all its terms different from , the sequence of the 
corresponding values 

^n ==/(*) (=1, 2,3,,..) 

of the function converges to c; or 

b) an arbitrary positive number e being chosen, another positive 
number 8 -= 8 (e) can always be assigned, such that for all values of x in 
the interval of definition with 

| x - | < 8 but * 4= , 

we have 9 

\f( X )-C\< S . 

The two forms of definition a) and b) mean precisely the same thing. 

Definition 5 (Right hand and left hand limits). If, in the case 
of definition 4, it is stipulated besides that all points x n or x taken into 
account lie to the right of f (which must not of course be the right hand 
endpoint of the interval of definition of / (#)), then we speak of a right 
hand limit (or limit on the right) and write 

lim/(*) = c; 

x->t + Q 

similarly we write 



and speak of a left hand limit (or limit on the left), if f is not the left hand 
endpoint of the interval of definition of /(#), and if points x n or x to the 
left of are alone taken into account. 



8 Cf. 8, 2, and also 62. 

9 The older notation \imf(x) for lim/(#) should be absolutely discarded since 



the whole point is that x is to remain 4= f. 



160 Chapter V. Power series. 

Definition 5 a (Further types of limits). Besides the three types 
of limit already defined, the following may also occur 10 : 

lim / = | 
or > c , -f- oo , oo 

/(*)-) 
with one of the five supplementary indications ("motions of x") 

for #->, *f+0, *f 0, +-\-oo, oo. 

With reference to 2 and 3 there will be no difficulty in formulating 
precisely the definitions in the form a) or b) which correspond 
to the definitions just discussed. 

Since, as remarked, ue assume these matters to be familiar to the 
reader, in all essentials, we suppress all elucidations of detail and examples, 
and only emphasize that the value c to which a function tends, for instance 
for x * , need bear no relation whatever to the value of the function at . 
Only for this we will give an example: let f(x) be defined for every x by 

putting f(x) = if x is an irrational number, but f(x) = if a; is a rational 
number which in its lowest terms is of the form - (q >> 0) . Thus e. g. f () 



0,etc. 
Here we have for every f 



For if s is an arbitrary positive number and m is so large that <I e , then 

in 

there are not more than a finite number of rational points whose (least posi- 
tive) denominator is < m . These we imagine marked in the interval 1 
...+! As there are only a finite number of them, we can find one nearest 
of all to ; (if f itself is one of these points we of course should not take it 
into account here). Let d denote its (positive) distance from f. Then every x t 
for which 

0<|as-| <d, 

is either irrational, or a rational number whose least positive denominator q 
is > m . In the one case, / f (a;) = 0; in the other, = <; <>. Therefore we 
have, for every xinQ<^\x \<Z.d, 

*-0<. 
i. e., as asserted, 

If therefore f is in particular a rational number, then this limit differs decidedly 
from the value f(g) itself. 

Calculations with limits are rendered possible by the following 
theorem: 



10 In the first of these three cases we say that f(x) tends or converges 
to c\ in the second and third cases: f(x) tends or diverges (definitely) to-f-QO 
or 00; and in all three, we speak of a definite behaviour or also of a limit 
in the wider sense. If f(x) shows none of these three modes of behaviour, then we 
say that / (x) diverges indefinitely for the motion of x under consideration. 



19. Functions of a real variable. 161 

Theorem 1. If f (x) , f% (x) , . . . f (x) are given functions (p some 
determinate positive integer), each of which, for one and the same 
motion of x of the types mentioned in Definition 5 a, tends to a finite

b) the function

are all continuous at . Corresponding statements hold, when only right 
hand or only left hand continuity is assumed. 

By repeated application of this theorem to the function f(x) ~ #, 
certainly continuous everywhere (since for x -> we have precisely x -> ), 
we at once deduce: 

All rational functions are continuous everywhere, with the exception 
of (at most a finite number of) points where the denominator = 0. In 
particular: Rational integral functions are continuous everywhere. 

Similarly, the limiting relations 42, 1 3, showed that: a x y (a > 0) is 
continuous for every real x\ log x is continuous for every x > 0; x* (a ~ 
arbitrary real number) is continuous for every x > 0. 

Definition 8 (Continuity in an interval). If a function is con- 
tinuous at every individual point of an interval /, then we say that it is 
continuous in this interval. Continuity at an endpoint of the interval is 
here taken to be continuity "inwards", i. e. right handed continuity at 
the left hand endpoint, and left handed continuity at the right hand end- 
point. These endpoints of/ may or may not, according to the circum- 
stances, be reckoned as in the interval. Functions which are continuous 
in a closed interval give rise to a series of important theorems, of which 
we may mention the following: 

Theorem 4. If f(x) is continuous in the closed interval a ^ x ^ b 
and if f(a) > 0, but f(b) < 0, then there exists, between a and b, at least 
one point f for which /() = 0. 

Theorem 4a. If f(x) is continuous in the closed interval a ^ x ^ b 
and 77 is any real number between /(a) and/ (b), then there exists, between 
a and b, at least one point f for which/ () = 17. Or: The equation/ (x) -= 17 
has at least one solution in that interval. 

Theorem 5. If f(x) is continuous in the closed interval a ^ x ^ b y 
then, having chosen any e > 0, we can always assign some number 8 > 
so that, if x' and x" are any two points of the interval in question whose 
distance | x" x' \ is < 8, the difference of the corresponding values of 
the function, | /(*") /(#') | , is < e. (The property, established by this 
theorem, of a function continuous in a closed interval is called uniform 
continuity of the function in the interval.) 

Definition 9 (Monotony). A function defined in the interval 
a ... b is said to be monotone increasing or decreasing in the interval, if for 
every pair of points x l and # 2 f that interval, with x l < # 2 , we in- 



19. Functions of a real variable. 163 



variably have f (x ) < f(x^) in the one case, or invariably f(x t ] 
in the other. We also speak of strictly increasing and strictly de- 
creasing functions, when the equality signs, in the inequalities between 
the values of the function just written down, are excluded. 

Theorem 6. The point f , certainly existing under the hypotheses 
of Theorems 4 and 4 a, is necessarily unique of its kind if the func- 
tion f(x) under consideration is strictly monotone in the interval a... b. 
Thus in that case, to each 77 between f(d) and f(b) corresponds one 
and only one for which /*() = rj. We say in this case: The inverse 
function of y = f(x) is everywhere existent and one-valued (or y = f(x) 
is reversible) in the interval. 

Definition 10 (Differentiability). A function f (x) defined at a 
point | and in a certain neighbourhood of f is said to be differentiable 
at * if the limit 



exists. Its value is called the (unique derivative or) differential coefficient 
of f(x) at and is denoted by /"'(). If the limit in question only 
exists on the left or on the right (that is, only for x *f-f-0 or 
x f respectively), then we speak of right hand or left hand 
differentiability, differential coefficient, etc. 

If a function is differentiable at each individual point of an inter- 
val /, then we say for brevity that the function is differentiable in 
this interval. 

The rules for differentiation of a sum or product of a particular (fixed) 
number of functions, of a difference or quotient of two functions, of functions 
of a function, as also the rules for differentiation of the elementary functions 
and of their combinations, we regard as known to the reader. 

All means necessary to their construction have been developed in the 
above, if we anticipate a knowledge of the limit defined in 1155 and there 
determined in a perfectly direct manner. If, for instance, it is inquired whether 
a x (a> and ={= 1) is differentiable, and, if so, what is its differential coefficient, 
at the point f , then, following Defs. 10 and 4, we have to choose a null se- 
quence (#) with terms all =f= and to examine the sequence of numbers 
__ **+*- a* a r -l 

A. = -- :_= a s - . 
Xn X n 

If we write y n for the numerator in the last fraction, then by 35, 3 we know 
that (y n ) is also a null sequence, and indeed one for which none of the terms 
is equal to 0. X n may then be written in the form 

J 



But since, as remarked, y n is a null sequence, we have by 



Since the same then holds for the reciprocal values, by 41, 11 a, we deduce 
A^-x^.log-fl. The function a* is thus differentiable for every x and has the 
differential coefficient a r -loga. 



164 Chapter V. Power series. 

In the same way, as regards differentiability and differential coefficient 
of log x for f !> 0, we deduce, by consideration of 



x n x n 

that the differential coefficient exists here and = -- . 

Of the properties of differentiable functions we shall for the pre- 
sent require scarcely more than is contained in the following simple 
theorems : 

Theorem 7. If a function f(x) is differentiable in an interval J 
and its differential coefficient is there constantly equal to 0, then f(x) 
is constant in /, that is to say is = /*(a? ), where X Q is any point of /. 

If two functions f t (x) and f^ (x) are differentiable in /and their 
differential coefficients constantly coincide there, then the difference of 
the two functions is constant in /, therefore we have 

&(*)- /i(*)+' = /i(*) + [/;(*o)-/;(*o)] 
where x is any point of /. 

Theorem 8. (First mean value theorem of the differential calculus.) 
If f(x) is continuous in the closed interval a ^ x <^ b and differentiable 
in at least the open interval a < x < b, then there is, in the latter 
interval, at least one point f for which 



(In words: The finite difference quotient relative to the endpoints of the 
intervals is equal to the differential coefficient at a suitable interior point.) 
Theorem 9. If /(*) is differentiable at and/' () is > (< 0) then 
/(#) "increases" ("decreases") at , i. e. the difference 

.// \ ^//-\i_ ( * ne same ) . /*. \ / r\ 

/(*)-/() has . s,gn as (to) (* - & 



provided | x | be less than a suitable number 8. 

Theorem 10. If f(x) is differentiable at an interior point of its 
interval of definition, then unless /' () = the functional value /() 
cannot be ^ every other functional value f(x) in a neighbourhood of 
of the form | x | < 8, i. e. cannot be a (relative) maximum point. 
Similarly the condition /' (f ) = is necessary for to be a (relative) 
minimum point, i. e. such that/() is not greater than any other functional 
value /(#), as long as x remains in a suitable neighbourhood of . 

Definition 11 (Differential coefficients of higher orders. If 
f(x) is differentiable in J y then (in accordance with Def. 1) /' (x) is again 
a function defined in / *. If this function is again differentiable in J l 



1 and called the derived function of f(x). 



19. Functions of a real variable. 165 

then its differential coefficient is called the second differential coefficient 
of f(x) and is denoted by /"'(#). Correspondingly, we obtain the third 
and, generally, the ft th differential coefficient of f(x), which is denoted 
by f (k) (x). For the existence of the k th differential coefficient at f it 
is thus (v. Def. 10) necessary that the (k l) th differential coefficient 
should exist both atf and at all points of a certain neighbourhood of . 
The J th differential coefficient of f^(x) is f( k +*(x), k^O, l^>0. (As 
th differential coefficient of f(x) we then take the function itself) 
Of the integral calculus we shall, in the sequel, require only the 
simplest concepts and theorems, except in the two paragraphs on Fourier 
series, where rather deeper material has to be brought in. 

Definition 12 (Indefinite integral). If a function f(x) is given in 
an interval a ... b and if a differ entiablc function F (x) can be found 
such that, for all points of the interval in question, F f (x) = f(x), then 
we say that F(x) is an indefinite integral of f(x) in that interval. ( Be- 
sides F(x), the functions F(x) -\- c are then also indefinite integrals 
of f(x), if r denotes any real number. Besides these, however, there 
are no others). We write 



In the simplest cases, indefinite integrals are obtained by inverting- the 
elementary formulae of the differential calculus E. g. from (sin a x)' = a cos ax 

it follows that \cosccxdx = -- and so on These elementary rules we 
J a 

assume known Special integrals of this kind, excepting- the very simplest, are 
little used in the sequel; we mention

Though in indefinite integrals, we find no more than a new mode 
of writing for formulae of the differential calculus, the definite integral 
introduces an essentially new concept. 

Definition 13 (Definite integral). A function defined in a closed 
interval a ... b and there bounded is said to be integrable over this 
interval if it fulfils the following condition: 

Divide the interval a ... b in any manner into n equal or un- 
equal parts (n ^> 1, a positive integer), and denote by x l9 a? a , . . . , # n _ 
the points of division between a = X Q and b = x n . Next in each of 
these n parts (in which both endpoints may be reckoned) choose any 



166 Chapter V. Power series. 

point, and denote the chosen points in corresponding order by g l9 f 2 , . . . , 
g n . Then form the sum 11 

S n = 2? (*-*_.!)/(&) 

i/-=i 

Let such sums S n be evaluated for each n = 1, 2, 3, ... independently 
(that is to say, at each stage x v and , may be chosen afresh). But, at the 
same time, / n , the length of the longest of the n parts into which the 
interval is divided when forming S ny shall tend to 12 . 

If the sequence of numbers S l9 S 2 > . . . , in whatever way they may have 
been formed, invariably proves to be convergent and always gives the same 13 
limit S, then f(x) will be called integrable in Riemann's sense and the limit 
S will be called the definite integral of f(x) over a . . . b, and written 

}f(x)dx. 

a 

x is called the variable of integration and may of course be replaced by 
any other letter. Instead of /() we may also take, to form S n , the 
lower bound <z v or the upper bound f3 v of all the functional values 14 in the 
interval #,.__! ^ x ^ x v . 

Theorem 1 1 (Riemann's test of integr ability). The necessary and suffi- 
cient condition for a function /(#), defined in the closed interval a ... b 
and there bounded, to be integrable over a . . . b, is as follows: Given 
e > 0, a choice of n and of the points x l9 x 2 , . . . , x n _ l must be possible, 
for which 



if i v = | x v A:,,_ I | 5s the length of the v th part of a ... b and v v the 
oscillation of f(x) in this sub-interval. 

This criterion may also be expressed as follows, assuming the notation 
chosen so that a < b: After choosing e, we must be able to assign two 
"step-functions" (functions constant in stretches) such that in a ^ x ^ b 
we have always 

*(*)^ /(*)<<?(*) 



11 If /(*) > 0, a > b, and we consider a plane portion S bounded on the 
one side by the axis of abscissae, on the other by the verticals through a and b and 
by the curve y f (x) t then S n is an approximate value of the area of S. This 
however only provides a satisfactory representation if y = / (x) is a curve in the 
intuitive sense. 

12 We may then also say that the subdivisions, with increasing n t become 
indefinitely closer. 

13 It is easily shewn that if the sequence (S n ) is invariably convergent it also 
ipso facto always gives the same limit. 

14 In these cases S n gives the area of a ("step-*') polygon inscribed or circum- 
scribed to the plane portion S.

It suffices in fact to put, in x v _ : ^ x ^ #, 

g (x) -= a,, G (x) = p v , v = 1, 2, . . . , w, 
together with (b) = a n , G (ft) - n . 

From this criterion, the following particular theorems are deduced: 

Theorem 12. Every function monotone in a ^ # ^ ft, and also every 
function continuous in a f^ # 5^ ft, is integrable over a ... ft. 

Theorem 13. The function/ (#) is integrable over a ... ft, if, in a ... ft, 
it is bounded and has only a finite number of discontinuities. 

Riemann's test of integrabiiity may also be given the following form: 

Theorem 14. The function f(x) is integrable over a ... ft if, and 
only if, it is bounded there and if, two arbitrary positive numbers 8 and e 
being assigned, the subdivision of a ... ft into n sub-intervals described 
in theorem 11 can be so carried out that the sub-intervals i v in which the 
oscillation of f(x) exceeds 8 add up to a total length less than e. 

Theorem 1 5. The function /(#) is certainly not integrable over a ... ft 
if it is discontinuous at every point of that interval. 

Theorem 16. If f(x) is integrable over ... ft, then/(,v) is also in- 
tegrable over every sub-interval a' ... ft' of a ... ft. 

Theorem 17. If the function /(jc) is integrable over a ... ft, then 
every other function f (x) is integrable over ... ft, and has the same 
integral, which results from/(.r) by an arbitrary change in a finite number 
of its values. 

Theorem 18. If f(x) and / x (x) are two functions integrable over 
a ... ft, then they have the same integral provided that they coincide at 
least at all points of a set everywhere dense in ... ft (e. g. all rational 
points). 

For calculations with integrals we have the following simple theorems, 
where /(*) denotes a function integrable over the interval ... ft.

this case a different value may have to be chosen for . 

We mention only the following of the applications of the concept of 
integral above considered: 

Theorem 28 (Area). Iff(x) is integrable over a . . . b, (a < b) and, 
let us suppose, always positive in the interval 18 , then the portion of plane 
surface bounded by the axis of abscissae, the ordinates through a and b, 
and the curve y / (x) or more precisely, the set of points (.v, y) for

in the plane of a rectangular coordinate system O x, O jy, when / describes 
the interval from a to /3, has a measurable length and this is given by the 
integral 

~~' 



Finally we may say a few words on the subject of so-called improper 
integrals. 



17 Here [7i (x)]* denotes the difference h (b) h (a). 

18 which may always be arranged by the addition of a suitable constant. 



170 Chapter V. Power series. 

Definition 14. If /(/) is defined for t^. a and is integrable over 
^ t ~i x > f r every x, so that the function 



is also defined for every x ^ a, then, if lim jP (x) exists and = c, we say 
that the improper integral 



converges and has the value c. 

Theorem 30. If f(t) is constantly ^ or constantly .< for every 

00 

t ^ a, then //(*) d t converges if and only if the function F (x) of Def. 14 

a 

is bounded for x > a. If f(i) is capable of both signs for t ^ a, then the 
same integral converges if, and only if, given an arbitrary e > 0, x > a 
can be so determined that 



for every x' and x" both > x . 

And quite analogously: 

Definition 15. If f(x) is defined, but not bounded, in the interval 
a < t <; b, open on the left, and is integrable, for every x of a <x <b, 
over the interval x ^ t ^ b, so that the function 

F(x)=*}f(t)dt 

X 

is defined for each of these x's, then, if lim F (x) exists and = c 9 we say 

A.-^ + 

that the improper integral (improper at a) 



is convergent and has the value c. 

Exactly analogous conventions are made for an interval open on the 
right. The case of an interval open on both sides is reduced to the two pre- 
ceding cases by dividing it at an interior point into two half-open intervals, 
and then taking theorem 19 as a definition. 

Theorem 31 . If in the case of Def. 15, we further have/(f) S> every- 
where or ^ everywhere, then the improper integral in question exists 
if, and only if, F (x) remains bounded in a < x ^ b. If f(t) assumes both 
signs, then the integral exists if, and only if, given e > 0, we can choose 
8 > so that 



for every x' and x" both between a (excl.) and a + 8. 



20. Principal properties of functions represented by power series. 171 

20. Principal properties of functions represented by 

power series. 

We interrupted our discussion of power series at the observation, 
terminating 18, that the sum of a power series, in the interior of 
its interval of convergence, defines a function, which we will now 
denote by f(x): 



We resume it at that point, and agree in this connection, unless 
special remark to the contrary is made, to leave the interval of con- 
vergence open at both ends, even should the power series converge at 
one or both of the endpoints. 

Now if, as is the case here, an infinite series defines a function 
in a certain interval, then the most important problem is, in general, 
to deduce from the series the principal properties of the function re- 
presented by it interpreting these for instance in the sense of the 
summary of the preceding section. 

In the case of power series, this presents no great difficulty. We 
shall see, on the whole, that a function represented by a power series 
possesses all the properties which we may consider particularly im- 
portant and that the algebra of power series assumes a peculiarly 
simple form. For this reason, power series play a prominent part, 
and it is precisely on this account that their discussion belongs to the 
elements of the theory of infinite series. 

In these investigations, we may, without thereby restricting the 
scope of the results, assume X Q = 0, i. e. assume the series to be of 
the simplified form 2 a n x n . Its radius of convergence is of course 
assumed positive (> 0), but may be + oo, i. e. the series may be 
everywhere convergent. We then have, first, the 

Theorem. The function f(x) defined, in its interval of conver- 96 

gence, by the power series a n (x x ( j) n , is continuous at x = x ; 

n=o 
that is to say, we have 

lim f(x) = lim J a n (x - xj = * = f(x Q ). 

n=0 



Proof. If < Q < r , then by 83, 5, 

00 00 

J^Kik n ~ l converges with J|0j n . 
n=l n=o 

If we write K(> 0) for the sum of the former, then we have, for 
every | x x \ < g, 

\f(*)- Q \ = \(*-*o)'2n(x-*o) n - l \^\* -*<>]*< 

n=*l 



172 Chapter V. Power series. 

If therefore e > is arbitrarily given and if d > is less than both 
Q and ;, then we have, for every | x X Q \ < 5, 

l/-ol<; 

which by 19, Def 6b, proves all that was required. 

From this theorem, we immediately deduce the extremely far- 
reaching and very frequently applied: 

97. Identity Theorem for power series. // the two power series 

2a n x n and ^b n x n 
n-o n-O 

have the same sum in an interval \ x\ < Q in which both of them converge l9 , 
then the two series are entirely identical, that is to say, for every n = 0, 1, 2, 
. . , we then have 

n = b n . 

Proof From 

(a) a + ^ x + a 2 * 2 -\ = b + 6 x + 6 3 x* ^ 

it follows, by the preceding theorem, letting x+0 on both sides of 
the equation, that 

o ^ V 
Leaving out these terms and dividing by x t we infer that for < \x\ < Q 

(b) *!+*** + ****{ =& 1 +& 2 * + &a a;9 H , 

an equation from which we deduce, in exactly the same way 20 , that 

*i = & i 
and 

ao+^aH = & 9 + 63^ 

Proceeding in this manner, we infer successively (more precisely: by 
complete induction) that for every n the statement is fulfilled. 

Examples and illustrations. 

1. This identity theorem will often appear both in the theory and in 
the applications. We may also interpret it thus: if a function can be re- 
presented by a power series in the neighbourhood of the origin, then this is 
only possible in one way. In this form, the theorem may also be called the 
theorem of uniqueness It of course holds, in the corresponding statement, for 
the general power series 2a n (x x ) n . 

2. Since the assertion in the theorem culminates in the fact that the 
corresponding coefficients on both sides of the equation (a) are equal, we may 
also speak, when applying the theorem, of the method of equating coefficients. 



19 Or even for every x = x v of a null sequence (x v ) whose terms are all =fc 0. 
In the proof we have then to carry out the limiting processes in accordance with 
19, Def. 4a. 

20 For x = 0, equation (b) is not in the first instance secured, since it was 
established by means of division by x. But for the limiting process x -> this is 
quite immaterial (cf. 19, Def. 4). 



20. Principal properties of functions represented by power series. 173 

3. A simple example of this form of application is the following: We 
certainly have, for every a;, 



v=0 



If we multiply out on the left, by 91, Rem. 1, and equate the coefficients on 
both sides, then we obtain, for instance, by equating- the coefficients of x k : 



a relation between the binomial coefficients which would not have been so 
easy to prove by other methods.

then f(x) is called an even function. If it is representable by a power series, 
then we at once obtain by equating 1 coefficients, 



so that in the power scries of f(x), only even powers of x can have coefficients 
different from 0. 

5. If on the other hand, f(x) = f(x), then the function is said to be 
odd. Its expansion in power series can then only contain odd powers of x. In 
particular, /"(O) = 0. 

We now proceed one step further and prove a number of theorems 
which must be regarded as in every respect the most important in 
the theory of infinite series: 

Theorem 1. // 08. 

n=0 

is a power series with (positive) radius r, then the function f(x) thereby 
represented, for \x X Q \ < r f may also be expanded in a power series 
with any other point x of the interval of convergence as centre; we 
have, in fact, *> 

where *= 



and the radius r of this new series is at least equal to the positive 
number r | x X Q \ . 

Proof. If x l lies in the interval of convergence of the series, so 
that | #! x 1 < r, then 



i. e. = 



174 Chapter V. Power series. 

and all that we have to show is that we may here group together 
all terms with the same power of (x &J, i. e. that the main re- 
arrangement theorem 9O may be applied. If, however, to test its 
validity, we replace, in the latter series, every term by its absolute 
value, then we obtain 'the series 



n=0 
and this is certainly still convergent, if 

K - *o I + I * - *i I < * > or I - *i I < ' - K - *o I 
If therefore x is nearer to # t than either of the endpoints of the 
original interval of convergence, then the projected rearrangement is 
allowed, and we obtain for f(x), as asserted, a representation of 
the form 



If we proceed in detail to group the terms containing (x - #,) fe to- 
gether, by writing the terms of the series (a) in successive rows one 
below the other, then the k th column gives 



which completes the required proof 21 . 

From this theorem we deduce the most diverse consequences. First 
we have the 

Theorem 2. A function represented by a power series 

/(*) = Jx(*-*o) n 

n=o 

is continuous at every point x^ interior to the interval of convergence. 
Proof. By the preceding theorem, we may write, for a certain 
neighbourhood of x , 

/(*)- Jk(*-*o)" = 2*.(*-xf 

n=0 n=0 

with 

& = J}* n (*i-*oT = f(*i)- 

rt=0 

For x *a? , the second of the representations of f(x), by 96, at once 
gives the required relation (v. 19, Def. 6): 

lim f(x) = f(xj. 



Theorem 3. A function represented by a power series 



n=0 



is differentiable at every interior point x of the ' interval of convergence 

21 We thus have, quite incidentally, a fresh proof of the convergence, 
already established in 95, of the different series obtained for the coefficients b k . 



20. Principal properties of functions represented by power series. 175 

(v. 19, Def. 10) and its differential coefficient at that point, f' '(xj, 
may be obtained by means of term-by-term differentiation, i. e. we have 



f fo) = n a n (x, - xjp-i = (n + 1) * w+1 (x, - x )\ 

n=l n=0 

Proof. Since f(x) = 2Jb n (x xj", we have for every x suf- 

n=o 

ficiently near x^: 



whence for x >a; 1 , by 96, taking into account the meaning of b 19 
we at once deduce the required result: f ( 1 ) = b l = 2 na n ( x i x o} n ~ l * 
Theorem 4. A function represented by a power series, 

f (*) = %*(* -*tf> 

n=o 

has, at every interior point x^ of its interval of convergence, differential 
coefficients of every order and we have 

/<*>(*,) = ^ = Z(n + !)( + 2) ... (n + k)a n + k (x, - * )"- 

n=o 

Proof. For every x of the interval of convergence we have, as 
we have just shown, 



f'(x) is thus again a function represented by a power series, and 
in fact by one which, in accordance with 95, has the same interval 
of convergence as the original series. Hence the same result may be 
again applied to f'(x}> giving 

r (x) = jj n (n + 1) * n+1 (x - * )i-i = 2(n + 1) (n + 2) * n + 2 (x - x ) n . 

n=i n=0 

By a repetition of this simple process, we obtain for every k, 



valid for every x of the original interval of convergence. Putting in 
particular x = x l9 we therefore at once deduce the required statement. 

If we substitute, for the coefficients b k in the expansion of theorem 1, 
the values -j-\f (k) ( x i) now obtained, then we finally infer from all the 
above the so-called 

Taylor series 22 . // for \x x Q \<r, we have 99.

and if x is an interior point of the interval of convergence, then we

have, for every x for which 23 | x x l \ < r l - r | x l X Q \, 




With Theorem 3 for the differentiation of our series, we couple the cor- 
responding theorem for integration. Since a function represented by a 
power series is continuous in the interior of its interval of convergence, 
it is also, by 19, Theorem 12, integrable over every interval contained, 
together with its endpoints, in the interior of this interval of convergence. 
For this we have the 

Theorem 5. The integral of the (continuous) function f (x) represented 

00 

by a n (x x ) n in the interval of convergence, may be obtained by means 

n-^Q 

of term by term integration, with the formula 



provided x t and x 2 are both interior to the interval of convergence. 
Proof. By 95, 2, the power series 



has the same interval of convergence as the given series 



=o 



By 98, 3, the first series is an indefinite integral of the second. Hence by 
19, Theorem 24, the statement follows at once. 

These theorems on power series we may complete in a special 
direction by the following important addition: Theorem 2 on the 
continuity of the function represented by a power series was, as we 
may again expressly observe, only valid for the open interval of con- 
vergence. Thus, for instance, in the case of the geometric series 2! x n , 



23 The number r l = r \ x l x \ of the text need not be the exact radius 
of convergence of the new series. On the contrary, the latter may prove considerably 

larger. Thus for f(x) S x n = ^ __ and x^ = - we obtain, by an easy cal- 
culation, .... /2\*+l / 1\*

and the radius of this series is not r | x^ x \ -= ^ but is

20. Principal properties of functions represented by power series. 177 
of sum ^ , we can deduce from our considerations neither its con- 

X ~ X 

tinuity at the point a; = 1, nor its discontinuity at rr=+l, by 
immediate inspection of the series. Even if the power series con- 
verged at one of the endpoints of the intervals (as here J for 

B = ij , we should not be able to conclude this fact directly. That 

however, in this last particular case, the presumption is, at least to 
some extent, justified, we learn from the following: 

Abel's limit theorem 24 . Let the power series f (x) = JJ a n x n 100. 

n=0 

have radius of convergence r and still converge for x = -f- r . 
Then \imf(x) exists and = Ja n r n . 

a?->r n o 

00 

Or in other words: If 2,a n x n still converges for #= -fy, then 

n = 

the function f (x) defined by the series in r < x <^ -f- r , is also 
continuous on the left at the endpoint x = -f- r. 

Proof. There is no restriction 25 in assuming r = + 1. For 
if 2a n x n has radius r, then the series Za^'x", in which a n ' = a n r n , 
obviously has radius 1; and the latter series is convergent at + 1 or 
1 , if, and only if, the former was at -j- r or r respectively. 

We therefore in future assume y = -J- 1 . Our hypothesis is, 
therefore, that f(x) = 2a n x n has radius 1 and that 2a n = s con- 
verges; and our statement is that 

3D 

\[mf(x) = s, i.e. = a n . 

*->l-0 n=0 

Now by 01 (v. also later, 102), we have for \x\ < 1, 

1 00 00 00 00 

* V a x n V rr n V a. rr n V * <r n 

1 _ x ^ a n X ~ X 2j a n X ~ 2. S n X > 
1 * n=o n =o n^O n-0 

if by s n we denote the partial sum of 2 a n . Consequently f(x) 
= (l x] 2s n x n and since 1 = (1 x)2x n , we therefore deduce, for 

\ X \<1> 

(a) s - f(x] (1 - x)2(s - sj x n ~(l - x}^r n x\ 

n=0 =0 

24 Journal f. d. reine u. angew. Math. Vol 1, p. 311. 1826. cf. 233 and 
62. The theorem had already been stated and used by Gauss (Disquis. 
generalcs circa seriem ..., 1812; Wcrke III, p 143) and in fact precisely in 
the form proved further on, that r n -* involves (1 x) 2 r n x n -> if x * 1 
from the left (v. eq. (a)). The proof given by Gauss loc. cit. is however in- 
correct, as he interchanged the two limiting processes which come under con- 
sideration for this theorem, without at all testing whether he was justified in 
so doing 

26 This remark holds in general for all discussions of (not everywhere 
convergent) power series of positive radius f. 



178 Chapter V. Power series. 

Here we have written s s n = r w , the "remainder" of the series; 
these remainders, by 82, Theorem 2, form a null sequence. 

If now e > is arbitrarily given, then we first choose m so large that, 

*" 

for every n > m y we have | r n \ < . We then have, for :g x < 1, 

2t 

\s-f(x) I ^ I (1 - x) Zr n x\ + | (1 - x) -Z x, 

w^O * n tn + 1 

hence, if /> denotes a positive number greater than | ^0 I + I r i I + 
+ |r m |, this is 

e v' -r- 1 

^/ (!-*)+ J(l -*)?. 

If we now write 8 = the smaller of the two numbers 1 and - then we 
have, for 1 - 8 < x < 1, P> 

!-/(*)! <y+ J = , 

which, by 19, Def. 5, proves the required statement "/ (x) -> s for x -> 1 
-0". 

We have of course, quite similarly, Abel's limit theorem for the left 
endpoint of the interval of convergence: 

X 

If E a n x n still converge for x = r, then 

w-=0 

lim/(*) exists and = ^ ( l) n n r n . 

x-> r + w-0 

The continuity theorem 98, 2 and Abel's theorem 100 together assert 
that 
101. lim (Za n x n ) =2a n % n 

*-> 

if the series on the right converges and x tends to from the side on which lies 
the origin. 

If the series Ea n n diverges, we cannot assert anything, without 
further assumptions, as to the behaviour of Ha n x n when x -> g. We 
have however in this connection the following somewhat more definite: 

Theorem If 2a n is a divergent series of positive terms, and Z a n x n 
has radius 1, then 

/(*) = a n x^+ oo 

H = 

when x tends towards + 1 from the origin. 

Proof. A divergent series of positive terms can only diverge to 

+ oo . If therefore G > is arbitrarily given, we can choose m so large 

that a + a^ + . . . + a m > G + 1, and then by 19, Theorem 3, choose 

8 < 1 so small that for every 1 > x > 1 8, we continue to have 

a + a 1 x+ ... + a m x m > G. 



21. The algebra of power series. 179 

But then we have, a fortiori, 

/(*)= 2 a nX >G, 

n 

which is all that required proof. 

Remarks and examples for the theorems of the present paragraph 
will be given in detail in the next chapter. 

21. The algebra of power series. 

Before we make use of the far-reaching theorems of the preceding 
section ( 20), which lead to the very centre of the wide field of application 
of the theory of infinite series, we will enter into a few questions whose 
solution should facilitate our operations on power series. 

That power series, as long as they converge, may be added and sub- 
tracted term by term already follows from 83, 3 and 4. That we may 
immediately multiply out term by term, in the product of two power 
series, provided we remain in the interior of the intervals of convergence, 
follows at once from 91, since power series always converge absolutely 
i/i the interior of their intervals of convergence. We therefore have, with 



also E * E b nX = E 

n n - 71 

provided x is interior to the intervals of convergence of both series 26 . 

The formulae 91, Rem. 2 and 3 were themselves a first application 
of this theorem. If the second series is, in particular, the geometric series, 
then we find 

oo QO on 

2 a n oc n E x n = E s n * n , 

n -0 H = O N---0 

1 TO 00 

i.e. - 2 a n x n = E s n x n 

A x w-0 n-O 

oo oo 

or E a n x n = (1 - x) E s n x n , 103 

n n --- 

where s n = a Q -f- a 1 + + a n , and \ x \ < 1 and also less than the 
radius of E a n x n . 

We infer in as simple a manner that every series may be multiplied 
and in fact, arbitrarily often by itself. Thus 

( E a n x n \ = E K a n + a l a n ^ + . . . + a n a Q ) X n ; 

Vi / n ^0 

and generally, for every positive integral exponent k y 

!a n x n } k = E a n w** 108 - 

i-O / w-O 



20 Here we see the particular importance of Cauchy's product (v. 91, 1). 



180 Chapter V. Power series 

where the coefficients a ( are constructed from the coefficients a n in a 
perfectly determinate manner even though not an extremely obvious 
one 27 for larger yfe's. And these series are all absolutely convergent, 
so long as 2a n x n itself is. 

This result makes it seem probable that we "may" also divide 
by power series, that for instance we may also write 



and that the coefficients c n may again be constructed in a perfectly 
determinate manner from the coefficients a n . For we may first, 

writing -- " = ', for n = 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . , replace the left hand ratio by 



1 _ 
and then by 



which must actually result in a power series of the form .Sc n x n , if 
the powers are expanded by 103 and like powers of x then grouped 
together. 

Our justification for writing the above may at once be tested 
from a somewhat more general point of view: 

We suppose given a power series 2a n x n (in the above, the 
series a n f a: n ) , whose sum we denote by f(x) or more shortly by y. 

n=0 

We further suppose given a power series in y, for instance 
g (y) = 2 b n y n (in the above, the geometric series 2 y n ) and in this 
we substitute for y the former power series: 

b o + *i K + i x + ) + 6 9 K + a i x + 0* H 

Under what conditions do we, by expanding all the powers, in 
accordance with 103, and grouping like powers of x together, ob- 
tain a new power series C Q + c x -}- c a x 2 -) ---- which converges and 
has for sum the value of the function of a function g(f(x))? We 
assert the 



104. Theorem. This certainly holds for every x for which 
converges and has a sum less than the radius of 2b n y n . 



n=0 



27 Recurrence formulae for the evoluation of a are to be found in 
/. W. L Glaisher, Note on Sylvester's paper: Development of an idea of Eisen 
stein (Quarterly Journal, Vol. 14, p. 79 84. 1875), where further references to 
the bibliography may also be obtained. See also B. Hansted, Tidbkrift for 
Mathematik, (4) Vol. 5, pp. 1216, 1881. 



21. The algebra of power series.

Proof. We have obviously here a case of the main rearrangement 
theorem 90, and we have only to verify that the hypotheses of that 
theorem are fulfilled. If we first write 

forming the powers by 103, and also suppose this notation 28 adopted 
for k = and k = 1, then we have, in

the series z'* 1 ' occurring in the theorem 90. If we now take, instead 
of y = 2 a n x" , the series 97 = 2 \ a n x" \ , and, writing | x | = | , form, 
quite similarly, 



(A') 



then all the numbers in this array (A'j are ^ and since furthermore 
^ I ^fe I *? fc was assume d to converge, the main rearrangement theorem 
is applicable to (A'), But obviously every number of the array A is 
in absolute value <^ the corresponding number in (A'); hence our 
theorem is a fortiori applicable to (A) (cf. 90, Rem. 3). In particular, 
therefore, the coefficients standing vertically one below the other in 
(A) always form (absolutely) convergent series 

00 

yjb k a^ k) = c n (for every definite n = 0, 1, 2, ...) 

and the power scries formed with these numbers as coefficients, i. e.

has the same sum as 2b n y n . We therefore have, as asserted, 



with the indicated meaning of 



n=0 



Remarks and Examples. 105. 

1. If the "outer" series gy) = ^b k x^ converges everywhere, then our 



theorem evidently holds for every x for which 2a n x n converges absolutely.

the latter for n = 0, 1 , 2 , . . ..

182 Chapter V. Power series. 

If both series converge everywhere, then the theorem holds without restriction 
for every ar. 

2. If a = and both series have a positive radius, then the theorem 
ceitainly holds for every ''sufficiently" small a, that is to say, there is then 
certainly a positive number g, such that the theorem holds for every | a; | < 
For if y = a t x -f <z a x* -f- i then rj = | a \ \ x \ -f- \ a 2 \ \ x* \ + ; and since for 
x > , we now also, by 96, have ij > 0, rj is certainly less than the radius 
of 2b k y k for all x whose absolute value is less than a suitable number g. 

y n 

3. In the series JE7 - , we "may" for instance substitute y = 2 x n for 

x n 
| x | <C 1 i or y for every n , and then rearrange in powers of x . 

4. To write, as we did above:

is, we now see, certainly allowed if ={= and further x is in absolute value 
so small that 



- x

which by Rem. 2 is certainly the case for every | x \ <[ Q with a suitable 
choice of Q . We may therefore say: We "may" divide by a power series of 
positive radius if ^ts constant term is =(= and provided we restrict ourselves to 
sufficiently small 20 values of x. 

To determine the coefficients c n by the general method used to prove 
their existence, would, even for the first few indices, be an extremely 
laborious process. But once we have established the possibility of the expansion 
which is at the same time necessarily unique by 97, we may determine 
the c n 's more rapidly by remarking that 

2a n xP'2c n gpss l f 
so that we have successively 



- 



From these relations, since a Q ^ 0, the successive coefficients c 0t c^ c z , . . . may be 
uniquely determined, the simplest method being with the aid of determinants, by 
Cramer's Rule, which immediately yields a closed expression 3o for c n in terms of 
a , a l9 . . . , a n . 

5. As a particularly important example for many subsequent investigations 
we may set the following question 31 : 

^ 



29 How small x has to be, is usually immaterial. But what is essential, is that 
some positive radius g exists, such that the relation holds for every | x \ < Q. 
The determination of the precise region of validity requires deeper methods of 
function theory. 

80 Explicit formulae for the coefficients of the expansion, in the case of the 
quotient of two power series, may be found e. g. in y. Hagen t On division of series,

in powers of x. Here the determination of the new coefficients becomes 
peculiarly elegant if we denote them, not by c nt but by ~, or as we shall

do, for historic reasons, by ~. Then the above equation is

If we multiply by n\ y we may write this more concisely: 



Now if we here had r in place of B v , for each v, then we could write instead 

w JB n =0; 106. 



and the recurring formula under consideration also may bo borne in mind under 
this convenient form, as a symbolic equation, i. e. one which is not intended to 
be interpreted literally, but only becomes valid with a particular convention, 
here the convention that after expanding the w tb power of the binomial (#+1), 
we replace each B v by B v . Our formula now yields, for n = 2, 3, 4, 5,.. 
successively, the equations

These are called Bernoulli's numbers and will be mentioned repeatedly 
later on ( 24,4; 32,4; 55, IV; 64). For the moment, we are able to infer 
only that the numbers B n are definite rational numbers. They do not, however, 
conform to any apparent or superficial law, and have formed the subject of 
many elaborate discussions 88 .

184 Chapter V. Power series. 

Finally we will prove one more general theorem on power series: 

CO 

Given the power series y = 2 a n (x x ) n , convergent for \ x x \ <r, 

w-O 

we have, for every x in the neighbourhood of X Q , a determinate corre- 
sponding value of y, in particular for x =-= x the value y = a Qt which we 
will accordingly denote by y . Then we have 

y - y = i (x - * ) + 2 (* - *o) 2 + - 

Because of the continuity of the function, to every x near x also corre- 
sponds a value of y near j> . We would now enquire whether or how far 
every value of y near y is obtained and whether it is obtained once only. If 
the latter was the case, not merely y would be determined by x, but con- 
versely x would be determined by y, and therefore x would be a function 
of y. The given function y=f(x) would, as we say for brevity, be 
reversible in the neighbourhood of X Q (cf. 19, Theorem 6). The 
question of reversibility is dealt with by: 
107. Reversion theorem for power series. Given the expansion 

y - :xo = i (* - * ) 4- a (* - *o) 2 + > 

convergent for \ x x \ <r, the function y =f(x) thereby determined is 
reversible in the neighbourhood of X Q> under the sole hypothesis that a 4= U; 
i. e. there then exists one and only one function x 9 (y) which is expressible 
by a power series, convergent in a certain neighbourhood of y , of the form 

* - *o = *i (y - y ) + b 2 (y - j ) 2 + . . . 
and for which, in that neighbourhood, we have (in the sense of 104) 



Moreover b 1 = 1 : a v 

Proof. As we have already done more than once, we assume in 
the proof that x and y are =0, which implies no restriction 33 . But 
we will then further assume that a l = 1, so that the expansion 
(a) y = x + * 2 x * + *3 * 3 + 

is the one to be reversed. That too implies no restriction, for since a 1 4= 0, 
by hypothesis, we can write a^ x + a 2 x 2 + . . . in the form 



in the numerator, a number with 107 digits. The numbers B z , B 4t . . . , to B 6Z 
had previously been calculated by Ohm, ibid., Vol. 20, p. Ill, 1840. The 
numbers B v first occur in James Bernoulli, Ars conjectandi, 1713, p. 96. A com- 
prehensive account is given by L. Saalschutz, "Vorlesungen uber die Bernoulhsclnen 
Zahlen", Berlin (J. Springer) 1893, and by AT. E. Norlund, "Vorlesungen uber 
Differenzenrechnung", Berlin (J. Springer) 1924. New investigations, which chiefly 
concern the arithmetical part of the theory, are given by G. Frobenius, Sitzgsber.

If we write for brevity a x = a/ and, for n ^> 2, 



and subsequently, for simplicity's sake, omit the accents, then we 
obtain precisely the above form of expansion. It suffices therefore to 
consider this. But we can then show that a power series, convergent 
in a certain interval, of the form 

(b) x = y + \ y 2 + b 3 y 3 -\ 

exists which represents the inverse function of the former, so that 

is identically = y, if this series is arranged in powers of y, in accor- 
dance with 104, i. e. all the coefficients must be = except that 
of y 1 , which is = 1. 

Since we have written, for brevity, x instead of a 1 x, we see that 
the series on the right hand side of (b) has still to be divided by <z 
to represent the inverse of the series a t x -f- <z a x* -j- , where a t has 
no specialised value. In this general case we shall therefore have 

b 1 = as coefficient of y 1 . 

If we assume, provisionally, that the statement (b) is correct, 
then the coefficients b v are quite uniquely determined by the condition 
that the coefficients of y 2 , y*, ... in (c) after the rearrangement, have 
all to be =0. In fact, this stipulation gives the equations 

, + a* = 



64 



from which, as is immediately evident, the coefficients b v may be 
determined in succession, without any ambiguity. Thus we obtain, the 
values 



but the calculation soon becomes too complicated to convey any clear 
idea of the whole. Nevertheless, the equations we have written down 
show that if there exists at all an inverse function of y = f(x), 
capable of expansion in form of a power series, then there exists 
only one. 

Now the calculation just indicated shows that whatever may have 
been the original given series (a), we can invariably obtain perfectly 



186 Chapter V. Power series. 

determinate values & r , so that we can invariably construct a powei 
series y -\- & 3 y 9 -|- which at least formally satisfies the conditions 
of the problem, the series (c) becoming identically = y. It only 
remains to be seen whether the power series has a positive radius 
of convergence. If that can be proved, then the reversion is completely 
carried out. 

The required verification may, as Cauchy first showed, actually 
be attained, in the general case, as follows: Choose any positive 
numbers cc for which we have 






and 2 cc v x v has a positive radius of convergence. Proceeding in the 
above manner, for the series: 

y = x a 2 x* 
whose inverse is, then, say, 



we obtain, for the coefficients /? y , the equations 

ft = GV + 2 Ai) 8 3 + 3 A s 4- 

....... ........... 

in which all the terms are now positive. Thus for every r. 

If, therefore, it is possible so to choose the cc v that the series 2 ft v y v 
has a positive radius of convergence, it would follow that 2 b v y v also 
had a positive radius and our proof would be complete. 

We choose the ccjs as follows: There is certainly a positive 
number Q, for which the original series x -f- a x* -\- converges 
absolutely. A positive number K must, however, then exist (by 82, 
Theorem 1 and 10, 11) such that we have, for every r = 2, 3, ..., 

We then choose, for y = 2, 3, . . ., 



so that we are concerned with reversing the series, convergent for 

\*\<e> 



But this function is immediately reversible. For we may at once see 
by differentiation we are dealing, in fact, with a simple hyperbola, 
of which the student should draw a graph for himself , that in

the function increases monotonely (in the stricter sense) from oo 
to the value 



and therefore possesses, for y < y lf a uniquely determined inverse 
whose values arc < a? 1 . For this, since 

y = x ~~ efe'-^g) r (X + e ^ 9 ~" e k + y }* + Q * y = ' 
we have, uniquely, 



Further 

if we write for brevity, with the above defined value of y t , 



and both y l and y 2 are >> 0, since the second is and the two have 
product = Q 2 . But

(1 2)! can actually be expanded in a power series beginning 

with 1 -*- + ' ' Assuming this result, it follows immediately that 

& 

x also may be expanded in a power series, convergent at least for 



X = 



By our first remarks the proof is hereby entirely completed. 
The actual construction of the series 

y + & 2 y 9 + 

from the series 

* + a ** H 

here also involves in general considerable difficulties and necessitates 
the use of special artifices in each particular case 34 . Examples of 
this will occur in 26, 27. 

We only note further, a fact which will be of use later on, that 
if (b) is the inverse of (a), then the inverse of the series 

(a') y = x-a^-\-a^ - H 

where the signs are alternated, is obtained from (b) by similarly 
alternating the signs, i. e. 

(V) * = y - b* y* + b a y 3 - + 

34 The general values of the coefficients of expansion b n are worked out 
as far as 6 13 by C. E. van Orstrand, Reversion of power series, Philos. Magazine (6), 
Vol. 19, p. 366, 1910. 



188 Chapter V. Power series. 

This is at once evident, if we first actually expand the powers of 

in (c), obtaining, say, 
(c) (y 



Under the new assumption, the same process, since the product of two 
series with alternating coefficients is again a series with alternating co- 
efficients, gives 
(c') (y - brf + ...)-. (J 2 - * (8 >^ + - - ) 



And from this we immediately infer that on equating to zero the coeffi- 
cients of y 2 , y 3 , . . . , we must obtain the identical equations (d), thus de- 
ducing for b v precisely the same values as before. 

The exact analogue holds good when the two power series contain, 
from the first, only odd powers of x. Thus, if the inverse series of 

y = X -f tf 3 #3 + a 5 X 5 -f- . .. 

is x = y + b 3 y* + b 5 y 5 + . . . , 

then the inverse series of 

y = xa 3 afi + az3f-\-... 
is necessarily x = y b. 3 y 3 + b 5 y 5 -- 1- . . . .

The expansions of the so-called elementary functions. 

The theorems of the two preceding sections ( 20, 21) afford us the 
means of mastering completely a large number of series. We proceed to 
explain this in the most important cases. 

A certain not very large number of power series, or functions 
represented thereby, have a considerable bearing on the whole of Analysis 
and are therefore frequently referred to as the elementary functions. 
These will occupy us first of all.

If we multiply this equation once more, in accordance with 91, by

which may of course be proved quite easily directly (by induction). 
If we do this, we may also deduce the equality 108 by repeated mul- 
tiplication of x " i w * m itself, by 103. 

1 x 

Since we have 

(n + p\ fn-rp\ , -t\nfp ^\ 
( P ) = ( n j = (- 1 ) ( n ) 

we obtain from 108, if we there write x for x and k for p +1> 

the formula 

109. 

valid for |a?| <1 and negative integral k. This formula is evidently 
an extension of the binomial theorem (29, 4) to negative integral 
exponents; for this theorem may for positive integral k (or for k = 0), 
also be written in the form 109, as the terms of the series for n > k 
are in that case all =0. 

Formulae such as those we have just deduced have as we may observe 
immediately, and once for all a two -fold meaning; if we read them from 
left to right, they give the expansion or representation of a function by a 
power series; if we read them from right to left, they give us a closed ex- 
pression for the sum of an infinite series. According to circumstances, the one 
interpretation or the other may occupy the foremost place in our attention. 

By means of these simple formulae we may often succeed in 
expanding, in a power scries, an arbitrary given rational function 



namely whenever f(x) may be split up into partial fractions, i. e. ex- 
pressed as a sum of fractions of the form 

A 

(x-a)' 

Every separate fraction of this kind, and therefore the given func- 
tion also, can be expanded in a power series by 108. And in fact 
this expansion can be carried out for the neighbourhood of every point 
x distinct from a. We only have to write 



( )' 

\x-aj

23. The exponential function. 191 

and then expand the last fraction by 108. By this means we sec, 
at the same time, that the expansion will converge for | x x \ < | a x \ 
and only for these values of x. 

This method, however, only assumes fundamental importance when 
we come to use complex numbers.

plays a specially fundamental part in the sequel. We proceed now 
to examine in more detail the function which it represents. This 
so-called exponential function we denote provisionally by E(x). As 
the seiies converges everywhere by 92,2, E (x) is certainly, by 98, 
defined, continuous and differentiate any number of times, for every x. 
For its derived function, we at once find 

so that for all derived functions of higher order we must also have 

We shall attempt to deduce all further properties from the series 
itself. We have already shown in 91, 3 that if x and x are any two 
real numbers, we have in all cases 

(a) (XL + aco) = E (x\)-E (x>>) . 

This fundamental formula is referred to briefly as the addition theorem 
for the exponential function 1 . It gives further 

and by repetition of this process, we find that for any number of real 
numbers x l9 # a , . . ., x k ,

holds for every positive integer k. Since E (0) = 1, it also holds for 
k = 0. If we now write, in (b), x v = ~ for each y, denoting by m 
a secon^ integer ^ 0, then it follows that 



or, ~ since (w) = [(!)] w , that 



If we write for brevity E(i) = E, we have thus shewn that the 
equation 

(c) E(x) = E x 

holds for every rational x^>0. 

If is any positive irrational number, then we can in any 
number of ways form a sequence (x n ), of positive rational terms, con- 
verging to f . For each n, we have, by the above, 



When w *-f co, the left hand side, by 98,2, tends to(f), and the 
right hand side, by 42, 1, to E , so that we obtain 

E(f) = E . 

Thus equation (c) is proved for every real x I> 0. 
But, finally, (a) gives 

E(- *)-(*) = E(a - a) = E(0) = 1, 

whence we first conclude that E (x) = cannot hold 2 for any real x 
and that for a; 



. 

E(x) E x 

But this implies that equation (c) is also valid for every negative 
real x. 

We have thus proved that the equation holds for every real x\ 
and at the same time the function E(x) has justified its designation 
of exponential function; E (x) is the ar th power of a fixed base, 
namely of 

l + i + i + ^ + ... + i + ... 



2 This may of course, for x > , be deduced immediately from the series, 
by inspection, since this is a series of positive terms whose term of rank 
is = 1.

k 0, 1, . . . , evidently has a coefficient ^> 0, but not greater than 
the coefficient 1/&I of the corresponding term of the exponential series. 
The same is also true, therefore, of the difference of the former and 
the latter term. Accordingly we have, for n > p from the manner in 
which p was chosen 5

for p is a fixed number also tends to 0, and we may choose 

w > p so large that this sum remains < ~ for every n > n {} . But 

we then have, for every n > n ,

which proves our statement 7 . For x = 1 , we deduce in particular

and more generally, for every real x y 



The new representation thus obtained for the number e, by the 
exponential series, is a very much more convenient one for the further 
discussion of this number. In the first place, we can, by this means, 
easily obtain a good approximation to e. For, since all the terms of the 
series are positive, we evidently have, for every n, 



or 



. e. 



8 We have (l_JL)->l f (i-jL\-+i 9 ..., fl -^-1)-* 1, and so their 
product (by 41, 10), also -> 1, or 1 - f 1 J . . . (l ^"" J -^0; so, as x 

and ^ are fixed numbers, the product of this last expression by T|#|^ 

also -*0; and similarly for the other terms. We can also infer the result 
directly from 41, 12 

7 The artifice here adopted is not one imagined ad hoc, but one which 
is frequently used: The terms of a sequence are represented as a sum 
x n = a; (n) + x^ + + fcj. n \ where the terms summed not only depend in- 
dividually on n, but also increase in number with n: k n > OO . If we know 
how each individual term behaves for n > oo , as for instance, that x v (n) for 
fixed v tends to v , then we may often attain our end by separating 1 out a fixed 
number of terms, say o: (n) -\-x^ (n) -f- -\-x p ^ with fixed p\ this tends, when 
n -> oo , to 4- f l -f + f , by 41, 9. The remaining terms, *> + . . . -f *> 

we then endeavour to estimate in the bulk directly, by finding bounds above 
and below for them, which often presents no difficulties, provided p was 
suitably chosen. 



23. The exponential function. 195 

\vherc s n denotes a partial sum of the new series for e. If we cal- 
culate these simple values e. g. for n = 9 (v. p. 251) then we find 
2 - 718 281< e < 2 718 282 , 

which already gives us a good idea of the value 8 of the number e. 
From the formula (a) we may, however, draw further important 
infeiences. A number is not completely before us unless it is rational 

and is written in the form . Is e perhaps a rational number? The 
inequalities (a) show quite easily that this is unfortunately not the case. 
For if we had e = , then for n = q, formula (aj would give: 



where s q = 2 -f- ^ -| ---- -f r. If we multiply this inequality by q\, 

then q \ s q is an integer, which we will denote for the moment by g, 
and it follows that 



But this is impossible; for between the two consecutive integers g and 
g -f- 1 there cannot be another integer p - (q l) 1 distinct from either : 
e is an irrational number. 

3. The above investigations give us all the information, with regard 

(x \ n 
1 -| -- ) , which we, in the first instance, require; the 

two problems A and B ( 9) are both satisfactorily solved. In spite 
of this, we propose, in view of the fundamental importance of these 
matters, to determine the same limit again and in a different way, 
entirely independent of the preceding. 

(1 \ n 
1 -| -- ) > e . 

This we will first extend by showing that

When y n = a positive integer, for every n, this is an immediate con- 
sequence of the previous result 9 .

J. M. Boormann (Math, magazine, Vol. 1, No. 12, p. 204, 1884).

If the numbers y n are not integers, there will still be for each n

and the sequence of these integers k n must evidently also tend to -|- oo. 

Now, however, if k n ^ 1, 



And since the numbers k are integers, the sequence

All the numbers y n ' must, however, be assumed < 1, i. e. 
y n > 1 , so that the base of the power does not reduce to or a 
negative value; this can always be brought about by "a finite number 
of alterations". Since 



and since, with y n , y n 1 also > -|- oo, the statement to be proved 
is an immediate consequence of the preceding one. 





Writing = z n , we may couple the two results thus: 






provided (z n ) is any null sequence with only positive or only negative 
terms, the terms in the latter case being all > 1. From this 
we finally obtain the theorem, including all the above results: 

Theorem: // (xj is an arbitrary null sequence whose terms are 

different from and > 1 from the first 10 , then u

10 The latter may always be effected by "a finite number of alterations' 
(cf. 38, 6).

23. The exponential function. 197 

Proof. Since all the x n 's =J= 0, the sequence (# n ) may be divided 
into two sub-sequences, one with only positive and one with only ne- 
gative terms. Since, for both sub-sequences, the limit in question, as 
we have proved, exists 12 and = e, it follows by 41, 5 that the given sequence 
also converges, with limit e. 

By 42, 2, the result thus obtained may also be expressed in the 
form 
(b) log, (1 + **) _ ! 

y 

x n 

which will frequently be used. 

By 19, Def. 4, the result also signifies that, invariably: 



From these results, it again follows, quite independently, as 
we announced, of our investigations of 1. and 2. , that 

('+3'-" 

for ( J is certainly a null sequence 18 , so that we have, by the pre- 



ceding theorem,

e and therefore (l + -)"-* e 9 , 

which was what we required 14 . 

4. If a > 0, and x is an arbitrary real number, then, denoting by log

C* G X T j i * ~ 2 I I Q I ** I 

is an expansion in power series of an arbitrary power. We deduce the 
limiting relation 15 

2Lni->loga for *->0, a> 0.113 



18 If one of the two sub-series breaks off after a finite number of terms, 
then we can, by a finite number of alterations, leave it out of account. 

18 We consider this null sequence for n > | x \ only, so that we may al- 

x ^ t 
ways have > 1 . 

14 Combining this with the result deduced in 2., that the above limit has 
the same value as the sum of the exponential series, we have a second proof 
of the fact that the sum of the exponential series is =e*. 

16 Direct proof: If the x n 's form a null sequence, then by 35, 3, so 
do the numbers ? = ** 1; and consequently, by 112 (b), 

a x *l y*log-a log- a

198 Chapter VI. The expansions of the so-called elementary functions. 

This formula provides us with a first means of calculating loga- 
rithms, which is already to a certain extent practicable. For it gives,

As roots whose exponent is a power of 2 can be calculated directly 
by repeated taking of square roots, we have in this a means (though 
still a primitive one) for the evaluation of logarithms. 

5. We have already noted that e* is everywhere continuous and 
differentiable up to any order, with e x = (e*}' = (e*)" = . It also 
shares with the general power a x ', of base a > 1, the property of 
being everywhere positive and monotone increasing with x. 

More noteworthy than these are the properties expressed by a 
scries of simple inequalities, of which we shall make use repeatedly 
in the sequel, and which are mostly obtained by comparison of the 
exponential with the geometric series. The proofs we will leave to

Each of these series represents a function everywhere continuous and 
differentiable any number of times in succession. The properties of 
these functions will be established, taking as starting point their ex- 
pansions in scries form, and it will be seen finally that they coincide 
with the functions cos a; and sin a; with which we are familiar from 
elementary studies. 

1. We first find, by 98, 3, that their derived functions have the 
following values: 

r9 _ c- f*u _ r* rill _ r xv/// _ C 

\_s ~~~ O , O ~~~~ v^ j ^ tJ ) \^f O , 

Qf _ f+ C" _ C C'" _ /"* o//// _ c . 

J -- O y O ~~~* O , O ~~~~ \s , O O , 

relations valid for every x (which symbol is for brevity omitted). 
Since, here, the 4 th derived functions are seen to coincide with the 
original functions, the same series of values repeats itself, in the same 
order, from that point onwards in the succession of differentiations. 
Further, we see at once that C(x) is an even, and (#) an odd, 

function: , N >-/\ o/ \ o/\ 

C ( x) = C (x) , 5 ( x) = 5 (x) . 

These functions also, like the exponential function, satisfy simple ad 
dition theorems, by means of which they can then be further examined. 
They are most easily obtained by Taylor 's expansion (cf. p. 191, foot- 
note 1). This gives, for any two values x t and a? a , since the two 
series converge everywhere (absolutely), 



and as this series converges absolutely, we may, by 89, 4, rearrange 
it in any order we please, in particular we may group together all 
those terms for which the derived functions which they contain have 
the same value. This gives 



-- Tr 

(a) C (x, + ar a ) == C (*J C (x,) - S (zj S (*,) ; 
and we find 17 quite similarly 

(b) S fo + ,) = S (*,) C (*,) + C ( 



17 Second proof. By multiplying out and rearranging in series form, 
we obtain from 

C(x t )C(x a )-S(x l )S(x a ) 

the series C (x l + x^) , as in 91, 3 for the exponential series. 

Third proof. The derived function of f(x) = 

[C (x, + x)-C (x,) C (x) + S (X L ) S (x)]* + [S (x, + x)-S (xj C (x) - C (xj S (*)f 
is, as may at once be seen, =0. Consequently (by 19, theorem 7), f(x)^f(Q) = Q. 
Hence each of the square brackets must be separately ~ 0, which at once gives 
both the addition theorems. 



200 Chapter VI. The expansions of the so-called elementary functions. 

From these theorems, whose form coincides with that of the 
addition theorems, with which we are already acquainted from an ele- 
mentary standpoint, for the functions cos and sin, it easily follows 
that our functions C and 5 also satisfy all the other so called purely 
goniometrical formulae. We note, in particular: 

From (a), writing x^ = x 9 we deduce that, for every x, 
(c) C(*) + S(*) = 1; 

from (a) and (b), replacing both x and x% by x: 



S(2x)=2C(x)S(x). 

2. It is a little more troublesome to infer the properties of 
periodicity directly from the series. This may be done as follows: 
We have 

C (0) = 1 > . 

On the other hand, C(2) < 0; for

and therefore C (2) < 1 -^ + 4 ~ ~~ "3" ' '* e ' certainl y negative. By 
19, Theorem 4, the function C (x) therefore vanishes at least once 
between and 2. Since further, as may be again easily verified, 



is positive for all values of x between and 2, and therefore 
C'(x)= S(x) constantly negative there, it follows that C (x) is 
(strictly) monotone decreasing in this interval and can only vanish at 
one single point f in that interval. The least positive zero of C(x), 
i. e. f, is accordingly a well defined real number. We shall imme- 
diately see that it is equal to a quarter of the perimeter of a circle 

of radius 1 and we accordingly at once denote it 18 by : 



From (c), it then follows that S 2 f~J = l, i. e. since S (x) was seen 
to be positive between and 2, that 

= 1. 



18 The situation is thus that n is to stand for the moment as a mere ab- 
breviation for 2; only subsequently shall we show that this number n has 
the familiar meaning for the circle. 



24. The trigonometrical functions. 
The formulae (d) show further that 

and by a second application, that 



201 



It then finally follows from the addition theorems that, for every x, 

c(x + ?) = -S(x), 
\ z / 

/~ / i \ /^ / M \ 

U (X -f- 71) = C (CC) , 

\ ' / \ / ' 

C(TT~- a;)= C(*), 



Our two functions thus possess 19 the period 2 TT. 

3. It therefore only remains to show that the number n, intro- 
duced by us in a purely arithmetical way, has the familiar geometrical 
significance for the circle. Thereby we shall have also established the 
complete identity of our functions C (x) and S(x) with the functions 
cos re and sin a; respectively. 

Let a point P (fig. 3) of the plane of a rectangular coordinate 
system OXY, be assumed to move in such a manner that, at the 
time t> its two coordinates are given by 

and 




then its distance | O P \ = Vrc 9 -f- y* from the origin of coordinates is 

constantly = 1, by (c). The point P therefore moves along the peri- 

meter of a circle of radius 1 and centre O. 

If, in particular, t increases from to 2 n, 

then the point P starts from the point A of 

the positive #-axis and describes the peri- 

meter of the circle exactly once, in the mathe- 

matically positive (i. e. anticlockwise) sense. 

In fact, as / increases from to n, x = C (t) 

decreases, as is now evident, from -f- 1 

to 1, monotonely, and the abscissa of P 

thus assumes each of the values between -f- 1 

and 1, exactly once. At the same time, 

S(f) remains constantly positive; this therefore implies that P describes 

the upper half of the circle from A to B steadily, and passes through 

19 2 n is also a so-called primitive period of our functions, i. e. a period, 
no (proper) fraction of which is itself a period. For the formulae (e) show that 

-^ = n is certainly not a period. And a fraction , with m>>2, cannot be

(O - \

seen to be positive between and 2 and in fact, as S (n x) = S (x) , is positive

between and n. Similarly for C (a;), (m > 1) cannot be a period.

each of its points exactly once. The formulae (e) then show further 
that when t increases from n to 2 n, the lower semi-circle is described 
in exactly the same way from B to A . These considerations provide 
us first with the 

Theorem. // x and y are any two real numbers for which x*-\-y 2 = I, 
then there exists one and only one number t between (incl.) and 2n 
(excl.\ for which, simultaneously, 

C(t) = x and S (t) = y . 

If we next require the length of the path described by P when 
t has increased from to a value t Qy the formula of 19, Theorem 29 
gives at once, for this, the value 





In particular, the complete perimeter of the circle is 

2n ___ SJT 

== / Vt' 2 + ST*dt = / dt = 2 n . 



The connection which we had in view between our original conside- 
rations and the geometry of the circle, is thus completely established: 

C (t), as abscissa of the point P for which the arc A P = t, coincides 
with the cosine of that arc, or of the corresponding angle at the centre, 
and S (t), as ordinate of P, coincides with the sine of that angle. From 
now on we may therefore write cos t for C(f) and sintf for S(t). 
Our mode of treatment differs from the elementary one chiefly in that 
the latter introduces the two functions from geometrical considerations, 
making use naively, as we might say, of measurements of length, angle, 
arc and area, and from this the expansion of the functions in power 
series is only reached as the ultimate result. We, on the contrary, 
started from these series, examined the functions defined by them, and 
finally established using a concept of length elucidated by the in- 
tegral calculus the familiar interpretation in terms of the circle. 

4. The functions cota; and tana; are defined as usual by the ratios 

cos x sin re 

cota; = , tan x = -- : 
sin x cos x 

as functions, they therefore represent nothing essentially new. 

The expansions in power series for these functions are however 
not so simple. A few of the coefficients of the expansions could of 
course easily be obtained by the process of division described in 105, 4. 
But this gives us no insight into any relationships. We proceed as 
follows: In 1O5, 5, we became acquainted with the expansion 20 

20 The expression on the left hand side is defined in a neighbourhood of 
exclusive of this point; the right hand side is also defined in such a neigh- 
bourhood, but inclusive of 0, and moreover is continuous for x~ 0. In such case 
we usually make no special mention of the fact that we define the left hand 
side for x = by the value of the right hand side at the point. 



24. The trigonometrical functions. 203 



1 v =o "1 2 




where the Bernoulli's numbers B v are, it is true, not explicitly known, 
but still are easily obtainable by the very lucid recurrence formula 100. 
These numbers we may, and accordingly will, in future, regard as 
entirely known 21 . We have therefore, for every "sufficiently" small x 
(cf. 1O5, 2, 4) 

x * 1 [ B * x * I ... 

^i^a""" 1 ^ 21 ^ ' 

The function on the left hand side is however equal to 

jL _-?. 
_ x / 2 \ _ xe *+\ _xe 2 +e 2 

""" 'A** 1 ' / ~~ 2 *-! ~~ 2 *. _* 

e*-e * 

and from this we see that it is an even function. Bernoulli's numbers J5 3 , 
B$ y B 7 are therefore, by 97, 4, all = 0, as already seen in 106, and we 

- x 

have, using the exponential series for e* and writing for brevity z: 



ST 5T 

If on the left hand side, we had the signs -j- and occurring alter- 
nately, both in the numerator and denominator, we should have pre- 
cisely the function zcotz. Dividing out on the left hand side by the 
factor z y so that only even powers of z occur, may we then deduce 
straight away that the relation 



, co t,_ 



obtained from our equality by alternating the signs throughout, is also 
valid? Clearly we may. For if, to take the general case, we have for 
every sufficiently small z: 



the same relation holds good when the + signs throughout are re- 
placed by alternate + and signs. In either case, in fact, the coeffi- 
cients c 2v are obtained, according to 105, 4, from the equations: 

c* + *>9 *=**'> c * + C a 6 2 +*>4 = &4 9 > ^ + c 4 6. J + c a 6 4 +6 tf =a a ; ...; 
czv + c 2 ,-2 & a H ----- h c a &Jv~2 + b-2 V = a 2v ; ... 



fl As appears from the definition, they are certainly all rational.

formula 22 :

(An expansion for 1 /cos re will be found on p. 239.) These ex- 
pansions, at the present point, are still unsatisfactory, as their interval 
of validity cannot be assigned; we only know that the series have a 
positive radius of convergence, not, however, what its value is. 

5. From another quite different starting point, Euler obtained an 
interesting expansion for the cotangent which we proceed to deduce, 
especially as it is of great importance for many problems in series 34 . 
At the same time, it will give us the radius of convergence of the 
series 115 and 116 (v. 241). 



* 2 This and the following expansions are almost all due to Euler and are 
found in the 9 th and 10 th chapters of his Introductio in analysin infimtorum, 
Lausanne 1748. 

28 We shall afterwards see that B 2k has the sign (-1)*" 1 (v. 136), so 
that the expansion of zcotg, after the initial term 1, has only negative coeffi- 

x 
cients, those of tanx and only positive coefficients. 

M The following considerable simplification of Euler' s method for obtaining 
the expansion is due to Schrdter (Ableitung der Partialbruch- und Produkt- 
entwicklung-en ttir die trigfonometrischen Funktionen. Zeitschrift fUr Math. u. 
Phys., Vol. 13, p. 254. 1868). 



Z*. me trigonometrical lunctions. 205 

We have, as was just shewn, 



or 



a formula in which we may, on the right, take either of the signs . 
Let x be an arbitrary real number distinct from 0, 1, 2, ..., 
whose value will remain fixed in what follows. Then 

jt X ( t 3i x , yi (x -f- 1) } 

jixcotnx = - 2 - 1 cot ~p- -f- cot 21 

and applying the formula (*) once more to both functions on the right 
hand side, taking for the first the -f- and for the second, the sign, 
we obtain 

jix f nx , f 3t(x + l) , jc(x-l)l . ^(# + 2)1 
n x cot n x = -j- |cot - f - + [cot - A -~ -f cot v 4 ; J -f cot ~~-^ j . 

A third similar step gives, for jixcotjtx, the value 



+ cot + cot + cot 



+ cot m^> + cot ^L^L + cot H* 8 =^ 

since here each pair of terms which occupy symmetrical positions 
relatively to the centre () of the aggregate in the curly brackets give, 
except for a factor 1, a term of the preceding aggregate, in accordance 
with the formula (*). If we proceed thus through n stages, we obtain 
for n > 1

and hence for each a =[= 

v 1 , a 1 



if in the above expression we letw*oo and, a^ /*Vs^ tentatively, carry 
out the limiting process for each term separately, we obtain the ex- 
pansion 



We proceed to show that this in general faulty mode of passage to the 
limit has, however, led in this case to a right result. 

We first note that the series converges absolutely for every 
x -\~ 1 2, ..., by 70, 4, since the absolute values of its terms

are asymptotically equal to those of the series JJ-^ . Now choose an 

arbitrary integer k > 6 | x \ , to be kept provisionally fixed. If n is so 
large that the number 2 n ~ 1 1, which we will denote for short by m, 
is > k, we then split up the expression (f) for nxcotx, as follows 35 : 



71X ( 

^- J 



(In the square brackets we have of course to insert the same expression 
as occurs in (f).) The two parts of this expression we denote by 
A n and B n . Since A n consists of a finite number of terms, the passage 
to the limit term by term is certainly allowed there, by 41, 9, and 
we have 

lim A n = 1 + 2 x* JS-r^-T-. 
->. M r^i* J -* f 

Also B n is precisely nx coinx A n , hence lim B n certainly exists. 
Let r k denote its value, depending as it does upon the chosen value ft; 
thus

Bounds above for the numbers B n , for their limit r k and so finally for 

the difference on the right hand side, may now quite easily be esti- 
mated: 

We have

But the bound above which we have thus obtained for r k is equal 
to the remainder, after the k ih term, of a convergent series 28 . Hence 
r k -~> as k -> + oo. If we refer back to the meaning of r k , we see that 
this implies

or, as asserted, 






a formula which is thus proved valid for every x ^ 0, + 1, 2, . . . . 
6. We shall in the next chapter but one make important applications 
(p. 236 seqq.) of this most remarkable expansion in partial fractions, as it is 
called, of the function cot. We can of course easily deduce many further 
such expressions from it; we make note of the following:

25. The binomial series. 

We have already, in 22, seen that the binomial theorem for 
positive integral exponents, if written in the form 



remains unaltered in the case 30 of a negative integral k. But we have 
then to stipulate | x | < 1. We will now show that with this restriction 



99 The formula first follows only for x =)= 0, 1, 2, ... but can then 
be verified without any difficulty for o? = 0, 2, 4, .... (The series has 
the sum 0, as is most easily seen from the second expression, for an even 
integral x.) 

80 In the former case the series is infinite only in form, in the latter it 
is actually so. 



25. The binomial series. 209 

the theorem holds 31 even for any real exponent a, i. e. 



, , 

(a any real number. 

As in the preceding cases, we will start from the series and shew 
that it represents the function in question 

The convergence of the series for [ x \ < 1 may be at once established; 
for the absolute value of the ratio of the (n + l) th to the n th term is 

and therefore >|a;|, 



which by 76, 2 proves that the exact radius of convergence of the 
binomial series is 1. It is not quite so easy to see that its sum is 
equal to the of course positive value of (1 -|- #) a If we denote 
provisionally by f a (x) the function represented by the series for | x \ < 1, 
the proof may be carried out as follows. 

Since 57 ( a \x n converges absolutely for I x I < 1, whatever may be 

\n / ' l 

the value of a, it follows, by 91, Rem. 1, that for any a and ^, and 
every \x\ < 1, we have 



Now 

as may quite easily be verified e. g. by induction 33 . Hence for 



81 The symbol f a J is defined for an arbitrary real a and integral n j> 
by the two conventions 



(:)- 



and for every real a and every n > 1 , it satisfies the relation, which may at 
once be verified by calculation. 



14 For this, give the statement, by multiplying by n\, the form 



F Z ~l7^(-^ 

Then multiply each of the (n -f 1) terms on the left hand side first by the corres- 
ponding: term of 

or, (a- 1), . .., (a-), ..., (a-w), 
then by the corresponding term of 

0?-n), (/J-M + 1), ..., (fi-n + k) ..... f 

and add, so that in all we multiply by (-f /? n)\ grouping together the similar 
terms on the left, we obtain precisely the asserted equality, where n is replaced 
by w-j-1. The above formula is usually called the addition theorem for the 
binomial coefficients. 




210 Chapter VI. The expansions of the so-called elementary functions. 

fixed | x | < 1, we have, for any a and f! 9 

fa'fp = A+0- 

By precisely the same method as we used to deduce from the 
theorem of the exponential function, E (xj E (x t2 } E(x 
that for every real x we had (E (x) = (E (I)/, so we could 
conclude that for every a, 

/- = (/;)", 

if we knew here also that f a was for every real cc (with fixed x) a 
continuous function of a. As f 1 = l-{-x, the equality 

fa - (1 + *) 
would then be established generally for the stated values of x. 

The proof of the continuity results quite simply from the main 
rearrangement theorem 9O : If we write the series for f a in the more 
explicit form 

(a) /L _ 1 + , + (^_)^ + (^_^ + |.) a - + ... 

and then replace each term by its absolute value, we obtain the series 



also convergent for | x \ <C 1 by the ratio test. We may accordingly 
rearrange the above series (a) in powers of cc, obtaining 

(b) fa =i 



i. e. certainly a power series in cc. Since this still for fixed x in 
| x | < 1 converges, by the manner in which it was obtained, for 
every cc> we have an everywhere convergent power series in a, hence 
certainly a continuous function of cc. 

This completes the proof 33 of the validity of the expansion 119 and 
at the same time fills the gap left in the proof of the reversion theorem 
21. 

83 An alternative proof, perhaps still easier than the above, but using- the 

00 /#\ 
differential calculus, is as follows: From f a (x) = J { ) x n it follows that 

n=0 vw/ 



Since however (" + 1 ) ( + j) = (" ) ' U follows further that

26. The logarithmic series. 211 

The binomial series provides, like the exponential series, an expansion 
of the general power a?: Choose a (positive) number c for which, on the 

one hand, tf may be regarded as known, and on the other, < - < 2. 



a 



Then we may write c = 1 + x with | x \ < 1 and so obtain, as the required 
expansion, 

* = *(!+*)* = T* l + X 



Thus e. g. 

= 5 L 1 ~~ \ 1 / 60 "f~ \ 2 ) 50-' ~~~ \ 3 / 50* ^ ' * * J 

is a convenient expansion of V2. 

The discovery of the binomial series by Newton M forms one of the 
landmarks in the development of mathematical science. Later Abel 35 
made this series the subject of researches which represent a perhaps equally 
important landmark in the development of the theory of scries (cf. below 
170, 1 and 247). 

26. The logarithmic series. 

As already observed on pp. 58 and 83, in theoretical investigations 
it is convenient to employ exclusively the so-called natural logarithms, 
that is to say, those with the base e. In the sequel, log* shall therefore 
always stand for log e x (x > 0). 

If y = log x, then x = e v or 
By the theorem for the reversion of power series (107), y = log x is there- 



thus, for every | x \ < 1, we have the equation 

(1 + *)/'<*)-/.<*) = <>. 

Since (1 + x)* > 0, this shows that the quotient 



has everywhere the differential coefficient 0, i. e. is identically equal to one and the

assertion /a (x) = (1 + jc) a is proved afresh.

to + 1, or y = log (1 + x) in powers of x, for every sufficiently small | x \ : 

y - log (1 + *) = * + ft, a* + ft 3 x* + . . . . 

The coefficients b n may actually be evaluated by the process indicated, 
provided the working is skilfully set out 36 . But it is advisable to seek more 
convenient methods: For this purpose, the developments of the preceding 
section suffice. For | x \ < I and arbitrary a, the function / a = / a (x) 
there examined is 



Using, for the left hand side, the expression (b) of the former paragraph 
and for the right hand side, the exponential series, we obtain the two 
power series everywhere convergent:

By the identity theorem for power series 97, the coefficients of corre- 
sponding powers of a must here coincide. Thus, in particular 37 , and 
for every | x \ < 1

Thus we have obtained the desired expansion, which, we also see a pos- 
teriori^ cannot hold for | x \ > 1 . If we replace in this logarithmic series, 
as it is called, x by x and change the signs on both sides of the equality, 
we obtain, equally for every | x \ < 1, 



By addition we deduce, again for every | x \ < 1 , 



There are of course various other ways of obtaining these expansions; 
but they either do not follow so immediately from the definition of the 
log as inverse function of the exponential function, or make more extensive 
use of the differential and integral calculus 38 .

87 Cf. the historical remarks in 69, 8. 

88 We may indicate the following two ways: 

1. We know from the reversion theorem that we may write 
log (1 H- x) = x + 6 2 * a + 6 3 x 3 -f . . . ; 
it follows from Taylor's series 99 that

27. The cyclometrical functions. 213 

Our mode of obtaining the logarithmic series also the two 
modes mentioned in the footnote do not enable us to determine 
whether the representation remains valid for x = -f- 1 or x = 1. 
Since however 120a reduces, for x = + 1> to tne convergent series 
(v. 81 c, 3) 



the value of this series, by Abel's theorem of limits, is 
= lim Iog(l + #) = log2. 

jc-yl .0 

Our representation (a) there remains valid for x = -f- 1; but for x -= 
it certainly no longer holds, as the series is then divergent. 



27. The cyclometrical functions. 

Since the trigonometrical functions sin and tan are expansible in 
power series in which the first power of the variable has the coeffi- 
cient 1, different from 0, this is also true of their inverses, the so- 
called cyclometrical functions sin" 1 and tan" 1 . We have therefore to 
write, for every sufficiently small | x \ , 

y = sin" * x == x -f- & 3 or* + & 5 # 5 + * 
y = tan" * x = x + & 3 ' x* + 6 5 f a; 5 -| ---- 

where we have left out the even powers at once, since our functions are 
odd. Here too it would be tedious to seek to evaluate the coefficients 
b and b f by the general process ot 107. We again choose more con- 
venient methods: The series for tan"" 1 a; is the inverse of

or of the series obtained by 1O5, 4 after carrying out the process of 

division in the last quotient. If here all the signs, in numerator and 

denominator, were -J-, then we should be concerned with reversing 
the function

Integrating, it follows at once, by O r theorem 5, since log 1=0, that 



The method in the text is so far simpler that it proceeds entirely without 
the use of the differential and integral calculus.

214 Chapter VI. The expansions of the so-called elementary functions. 
But the inverse of this function is, as we immediately find, 



By the general remark at the end of 21, the reverse series of the series 
for x = tanjy actually before us is obtained from the series last written 
down by alternating the signs 39 again, i. e. 

121. tm~ l x = *- + ?-+ . 

If therefore this power series, which obviously has the radius of conver- 
gence 1, is substituted for y in the quotient on the right of (a), and this 
is then rearranged, as is certainly allowed, we obtain the terminating 
power series x. Hence its sum for an arbitrary given \ x \ < 1 is a solution 
of tan y = x, and is precisely the so-called principal value of the function 
tan" 1 x hereby defined, i. e. the value which is = for x = and then 
varies continuously with x. Hence for !<#< + !, it satisfies the 
condition 



and is defined, in the interior of this interval, without any ambiguity. 

For \x\ >1 the expansion obtained is certainly no longer valid; 
but Abel's theorem of limits shews that it does still hold for x 1. 
For the series remains convergent at both endpoints of the interval of 
convergence and tan" 1 x is continuous at both these points. We have 
therefore in particular the series, peculiarly remarkable for clearness and 
simplicity: _ _ _ 

4 A 3^5 7 T- 

giving at the same time a first means of determining TT of some practical 
value. This beautiful equation is usually named after Leibniz w \ it may 
be said to reduce the treatment of the number IT to pure arithmetic. It 
is as if, by this expansion, the veil which hung over that strange number 
had been drawn aside.

d tan" 1 x 1 _ 1 __ 1 _, 2 r 4 i

the latter for | x \ < 1. As tan" 1 = 0, it follows by 99, theorem 5, that for | x \ < 1, 

x* 



tan' 1 *-*- 3 +-5 -+ 
A method corresponding to that given first in the preceding footnote is some- 
what more troublesome here, as the differential coefficients of higher order of tan" 1 x 
even at the single point are not easy to find directly. The expansion of 
tan" 1 x was found in 1671 by J. Gregory, but did not become known till 1712. 

40 He probably discovered it in 1673 from geometrical considerations and 
without reference to the inverse tan-series. 



Exercises on Chapter VI. 215 

For the deduction of a series for sin"" 1 a;, the method which we 
have just used for tan"" 1 a; is not available. The process indicated 
in the last footnote, however, provides the desired series: We have 
for x < 1

This power series also has radius 1, and on quite similar grounds to 
the above we conclude that for | x | < 1 its sum is the principal value 
of sin" 1 a;, i. e. that uniquely determined solution y of the equation 

sin y = x which lies between -^ and + TT 

For #= 1, the equality is not yet secured. By Abel's theorem 
of limits it will hold there if, and only if, the series converges there. 
As we have a mere change of sign in passing from -}- x to x, this 
only needs testing for the point -f- 1 . There we have a series of po- 
sitive tcims and it suffices to show that its partial sums are bounded. 
Now for < x < 1, if we denote by s n (x) the partial sums of 123, 

s n (x) < sin" 1 a; < sin~ 1 l = -|. 
And as this holds (with fixed n) for every positive x < 1, we also have

Chapter VII. 

Infinite products. 

28. Products with positive terms. 
An infinite product 

is, by 11, II, to be taken merely as representing a new symbol for the 
sequence of the partial products 

*/! 2 . . . u n . 

Accordingly such an infinite product should be called convergent, with 
value U y oo 

if the sequence of the partial products tends to the number U as limit. 
But this is particularly inconvenient, owing to the fact that then every 
product would have to be called convergent for which a single factor was 
= 0. For if u m were 0, then the sequence of partial products also would 
tend to U = 0, since its terms would all be equal to for n ^ m. Simi- 
larly every product would be convergent again with the value for 
which from some m onwards 

In order to exclude these trivial cases, we do not describe the behaviour 
of an infinite product by that of the sequence of its partial products, 
but adopt the following more suitable definition, which takes into 
account the peculiar part played by the number in multiplication: 

125. o Definition. The infinite product 

CO 

L * n = U^ Uq ' Uft . 

n=i 

will be called convergent (in the stricter sense) if from some point 
onwards say for every n > m ~ no factor vanishes, and if the 
partial products, beginning immediately beyond this point 



tend, as n increases, to a limit, finite and different from 0. 
// this be = f/ w , then the number 

U = u l .u.>-....u m -V m , 
obviously independent of m, is regarded as the value of the product*. 

1 Infinite products are first found in F. Vieta (Opera, Leyden 1646, p. 400) 
who gives the product 



28. Products with positive terms. 219 

We then have first, as for finite products, the 

o Theorem 1. A convergent infinite -product has the value if, 
and only if, one of its factors is = . 

As further p n -i~-+U m with p n +U m> and as U m is 4= 0, we 
have (by 41,11) 

u = -*i *1 

W Pn-l 

and we have the 

o Theorem 2. The sequence of the factors in a convergent infinite 
product always tends >1. 

On this account, it will be more convenient to denote the factors 
by u n = 1 -f- a n , so that the products considered have the form 

// (! + ) 
n=i 

For these, the condition a n > is then a necessary condition for con- 
vergence. The numbers a n as the most essential parts of the factors 
will be called the terms of the product. If they are all ^> 0, then 
as in the case of infinite series, we speak of products with positive 
terms. We will first concern ourselves with these. 

The question of convergence is entirely answered here by the 

Theorem 3. A product 77 (1 -f- a n ) with positive terms a n is 
convergent if, and only if, the series a n converges. 

Proof. The partial products p n = (1 -J- t )- (1 + # n )> since 
a n ^ increase monotonely; hence the First main criterion (46) is 
available and we only have to show that the partial products p n are 
bounded if, and only if, the partial sums s n = a t + > ~l ---- + # are 
bounded. Now by 114 a, 1 -f- a v <[ e a >" and so for each n 

p n ^e'> 
on the other hand 



the latter because in the product, after expansion, we have, besides the 
terms of s n , many others, but all non-negative ones, occurring. 
Thus for each n

the product

But infinite products first secured a footing- in mathematics through Enter, who 
established a number of important expansions in infinite product form. The first 
criteria of convergence are due to Cauchy. 



220 Chapter VII. Infinite products. 

The former inequality shows that p n remains bounded when s n does, 
the latter, conversely, that s n remains bounded when p n does, which 
proves the statement. 9 

Examples. 

1. As we are already acquainted with a number of examples of con- 
vergent series 2 a n with positive terms, we may obtain, by theorem 3, as many 
examples of convergent products J7(l+0 n ). We may mention: 

(l +~) is convergent for a. > 1, divergent for a <J 1. The latter 
is more easily recognised here than in the corresponding series 3 , for

With theorem 3 we may at once couple the following very 
similar 

Theorem 4. //, for every n, a n ^ 0, then the product //(I fl w ) 
also is convergent if, and only if, 2 a n Converges. 

Proof. If a n does not tend to 0, both the series and the pro- 
duct certainly diverge. But if a n * 0, then from some point onwards, 
say for every n > m, we have a n < \, or 1 a n > ^. We consider 
the series and product from this point onwards only. 

Now if the product converges, then the monotone decreasing 
sequence of its partial products p n = (1 a <m + i)*"(l O tends to 
a positive (> 0) number U m , and, for every n > m, 

Since, for <C a r <C 1, we always have 

(as is at once seen by multiplying up), we certainly have 

\ ' in T* I/ V i WIT 2' V n/ ^J 

9 In the first part of the proof of this elementary theorem, we use the 
transcendental exponential function. We can avoid this as follows: If 
converges, choose m so that for every n > m

As, obviously, for these w's, we now have 
(1 -f a +1 )--- (l-f-a)<l-l-K- M + - 
-f K + i + - 
we certainly have, for all w's, 



hence (/>) is bounded. 

8 In this we have therefore, on account of theorem 3, a new proof of the 

divergence of 5] . 



29. Products with arbitrary terms. Absolute convergence. 221 

Accordingly the convergence of the product 77(1 -f- a n ], and hence of 
the series 2 a n , results from that of 77(1 a n ). If, conversely, 
2 a n converges, then so does S 2 a n , and consequently by Theorem 3 the 
product 77 (1 + 2 a n ) also does. Hence, with a suitable choice of K, the 
products (1 + 2 a m+1 ) . . . (1 + 2 a n ) remain < K. If we now use the fact 
that, for ^ a v ^ , 

1 - a v ^ r+ 2 
as may again be seen by multiplying up we infer 



and the partial products on the left hand side, as they form a mono- 
tone decreasing sequence, therefore tend to a positive limit: i. e. the 
product 77(1 <z n ) is convergent.

2. If a n < 1 and if 27 a n diverges, then II (I a n ) is not convergent, with 
our definition. As however the partial products p n decrease monotonely and remain 
> 0, they have a limit, but one which is necessarily = 0. We say that the product 
diverges to 0. The exceptional part played by the number thus involves us in 
some slight incongruity of expression. A product is called divergent whose partial 
products form a decidedly convergent sequence, namely a null sequence, (p n ). The 
addition "in the stricter sense" to the word "convergent" in Def. 125 is intended 
to serve as a reminder of this fact.

Proof, a) If the product converges, then from some point on- 
wards, say for every n > m, we have a n ={= 1, and the partial

tend to a limit 4= 0. Hence there exists (v. 41, 3) a positive number /f 
such that, for every n > m, \p n \ ^ /? > 0. By the second principal 
criterion 49 we may now, given e > 0, determine w so that for

that if p n tends to a limit at all, this certainly cannot be 0. But 
we may now, given e > 0, choose the number n so that for everv 
n > n Q and every k ^> 1,

or 



And this shows that p n really has a unique limit. Thus the conver- 
gence of the product is established. 

As in the case of infinite series, so similarly in that of infinite 
products, those are the most easily dealt with which converge "abso- 
lutely". By this we do not mean products IT u n for which H\u n \ 
also converges, such a definition would be valueless, since then 
every convergent product would also be absolutely convergent, but 
we define, on the contrary, as follows: 

127. o Definition. The product 77(1 + a n ) is said to be absolutely con- 
vergent if the product 77(l + |a n |) converges. 

6 Or v. 81, 2nd form if invariably 

f (1 + a n + 1 ) (1 -f * + *) . (1 + a n 4.^)] _ ! . 
or v. 81, 3 rd form if invariably 

[(1 + +!) ..(H- ,+*)] -*1. 



29. Products with arbitrary terms. Absolute convergence. 223 

This definition only gains significance through the theorem: 

o Theorem 6. The convergence of 17(1 -f- | a n | ) involves that of 

+ O- 

Proof. We have invariably 

I (1 + + ,)(! + +,) .(1 + +)-!! 



as is at once verified by multiplying out. If therefore the necessary 
and sufficient condition for the convergence of Theorem 5 is satisfied 
by 77(1 -|- | a n \), it is ipso facto satisfied by 77(1 + a n ), q. e. d. 

In consequence of Theorem 3, we may therefore at once state 

o Theorem 7. A product 77(1 + a n ) is absolutely convergent if, 
and only if, a n converges absolutely. 

As we have an already sufficiently developed theory for the 
determination of the absolute convergence of a series, Theorem 7 solves 
the problem of convergence in a satisfactory manner for absolutely 
convergent products. In all other cases, the following theorem reduces 
the problem cf convergence of products completely to the correspond- 
ing one for series: 

Theorem 8. The product 77(1 -f- O converges if, and only if 
the series ^ 

2 log (! + ) 

n=w-i-l 

commencing with a suitable index*, converges. And the convergence of 
the product is absolute if, and only if, that of the series is so. 
Furthermore, if L is the sum of the series, then 



n=L 

Proof, a) If 77(1 -f- a n ) converges, then a n >0 and hence from 
some point onwards, say for every n > m, we have | a n \ < 1. Since, 
further, the partial products 

= (!+ , + i^ (! + )> (n > }> 

tend to a limit U m 4= (hence positive), we have by (42, 2), 



But log/> n is the partial sum, ending with the th term, of the series 
in question. This, therefore, converges to the sum L = log U m . 
As U e L , we thus have 



b) If, conversely, the series is known to converge, and to have 
the sum L, then we have precisely log p n >L, and consequently 
(by 42, 1) 



This completes the proof of the first part of the theorem, since <? 

e It suffices to choose m so that for every n ;> m we have | a m \ < 1 . 



224 Chapter VII. Infinite products. 

To deduce, finally, that the series and product are, in every 
possible case, either both or neither absolutely convergent, we use with 
theorem 7 and 70, 4, the fact that (112, b), when a n ->0 

>* a + ) I , 



(Here any terms a n which = may be simply omitted from con- 
sideration.) 

Although we have thus completely reduced the problem of the 
convergence of infinite products to that of infinite series, yet the 
result cannot entirely satisfy us, because of the difficulties usually 
involved in the practical determination of the convergence of a series 
of the form J^log (1 + a n ). The want here felt may, at least partially, 
be supplied by the following 

Theorem 9. The series (starting with a suitable initial index) 
JHog (1 -j- a n ) and with it the product 77(1 -j- a n ), is certainly convergent, 
if 2 a n converges and if 2a^ is absolutely convergent 7 . 

Proof. We choose m so that for every n ~> m, we have \a n \ < ~, 
and consider 77(1 + a n ) and 2 log (1 -|- aj, starting with the (m + l)* h 
terms. If we write 



then the numbers # M so determined certainly form a bounded sequence, 
for 8 , as a n ->0, ft n ~ > J. If therefore 2 a n and J?|0 n | a are con- 
vergent, J?log(l + fl n ), and hence also 77(l-|-a n ), is convergent. 

This simple theorem leads easily to the following further theorem 
Theorem 10. If2a^ is absolutely convergent, and \a n \ is < 1 
for eveiy n > m, then the partial products

p n = J[ (1 + 0J and the partial sums s n = a v (n > m) } 

v=wfl v=m-H 

are so related that p n s^, e*n 

i. e. the ratio of the two sides of this relation tends to a definite limit, 
finite and =f= 0> whether or no 2a n converges. 



7 J*fl rt 2 , if convergent at all, is certainly absolutely convergent. We adopt 
the above wording so that the theorem may remain true for complex a n 's, 
for which n 2 is not necessarily ;> (cf. 57).

And those terms which are possibly = may be again simply neglected, as 
they have no influence on the question under consideration. 



29. Products with arbitrary terms. Absolute convergence. 225 

Proof. If we adopt the notation of the preceding proof, then, as 
log (1 + a n ] = a n -|- $'&, we have for every n > m 

(l + m+1 ) -(! + )= A 

vm+l 

if the sums in the last two exponents are taken also from v = m -f- 1 
to v = n . 

And as 2$ n a^, the $ n 's being bounded, converges absolutely 
when -0 n a does so, we can, from the above equation, at once infer 
the result stated. This theorem also provides the following, often 
useful 

Supplementary theorem. // 2a n * converges absolutely, then 2a n 
and /7(1 -f- a n ) converge and diverge together. 

Remarks and examples. 128. 

1. The conditions of Theorem 9 are only sufficient', the product 77(1 + n ) 
may converge, without 2 a n converging. But in that case, by Theorem 10, 
v I a la must also diverge.

Accordingly the limits lim - = c and lim [h n log n] = log c = C exist, the 

latter because c ^= 0, hence > 0. The number C defined by the second limit is 
called Ruler's or Mascherom's constant. Its numerical value is C = 0-577 215 6649 . . . 
(cf. Ex. 86 a, 176, 1 and 64, B, 4). The latter result gives us further valuable 
information as to the degree of divergence of the harmonic series, as it gives 

h n ^ log n . 

Further the estimates of bounds above made for the proot of Theorem 3 show, 
even more precisely, if we there put a y = , that

30. Connection between series and products. 
Conditional and unconditional convergence. 

We have more than once observed that an infinite series 2 a n is 
merely another symbol for the sequence (sj of its partial sums. Apart 
from the fact that we have to take into account the exceptional part 
played by the value in multiplication, the corresponding remark holds 
good for infinite products. It follows that, with this reservation, every 
series may be written as a product and every product as a series. 
As regards detail, this has to be done as follows : 



129. 1. If ZT(l ~t" a n) * s &i ven > t ^ ien th* 3 P r duct, if we write 

H (! + ) = />> 



represents essentially the sequence ( n ). This sequence, on the other 
hand, is represented by the series 



This and the given product have the same meaning if the product 
converges in accordance with our definition. But the series may also 
have a meaning without this being the case for the product (e. g. if 
the factor (l -f- # 5 ) is = and all other factors are = 2). 

00 

2. If conversely the scries a n is given, then it represents the 

n=l 



sequence for which s n = J^<V This is also what is meant by the 

r = l 

product 

.*..*... . 7^_ln ^. . fiL , _ __ \ 

Sl * * 2 =Sl n iVW" * ni\ [ > + ^ + . + -"-M n - 1 '' 

provided it has a meaning at all. And for this obviously all that 
we require is that each s n 4= 0. In general the convergence of the product 
implies the convergence of the series, and conversely. In the case, however, 
of s n -> 0, although we call the series convergent with sum 0, we say that 
the product diverges to 0. ^ ^ 

Thus e. g. the symbols E ^ and ~ // (l + o^rio 

=-! * = X * 

JUVi) 

have precisely the same meaning. 



30. Connection between series and products. 227 

It is, however, only in rare cases that a passage such as this 
from the one symbol to the other will be advantageous for actual 
investigations. The connection between series and products which is 
theoretically conclusive was, moreover, established by Theorem 8 alone, 
or by Theorem 7, if we are concerned with the mere question of 
absolute convergence. In order to show the bearing of these theorems 
on general questions, we may prove as analogue of Theorem 88, 1, 
and 89, 2, the following: 

Theorem 11. An infinite product 77(1 + 0J is unconditionally 130 
convergent i. e. remains convergent, with value unaltered, however 
its factors be rearranged (v. 27, 3) if, and only if, it converges 
absolutely 9 . 

Proof. We suppose given a convergent infinite product 77(1 + # n )- 
The terms a n , certainly finite in number, for which |0 n |^>, we re- 
place by 0. In so doing, we only make a "finite number of alterations" 
and we ensure | a n \ < \ for every n. The number m in the proof of 
theorem 8 may then be taken ~ 0. We first prove the theorem for 
the altered product. 

Now, with the present values of a u , 

/7(1 + J and 2-log(l + O 

are convergent together, and their values U and L stand in the relation 
U = e L to one another. It follows that a rearrangement of the factors 
of the product leaves this convergent, with the same value 17, if and 
only if the corresponding rearrangement of the terms of the series also 
leaves this convergent, with the same sum. But this, for a series, is 
the case if, and only if, it converges absolutely. By theorem 8 the same 
therefore holds for the product 

Now if, before the rearrangement, we have made a finite number 
of alterations, and then after the rearrangement make them again in 
the opposite sense, this can have no influence on the present question. 
The theorem is therefore true for all products 

Additional remark. Using the theorem of Riemann proved later 
(187) we can of course say, more precisely: If the product is not 
absolutely convergent and has no factor =0, then we can by suitable 
rearrangement of its factors, always arrange that the sequence of its 
partial products has prescribed lower and upper limits x and /*, provided 
they have the same sign as the value of the given product 10 . Here 
* and ft may also be or 00.

10 For a convergent infinite product has certainly only a finite number 
of negative factors; and their number is not altered by the rearrangement.

Closed and numerical expressions for the sums 

of series. 

31. Statement of the problem. 

In Chapters III and IV, we were concerned mainly with our 
problem A, the question of the convergence of series, and it was not 
till the last few chapters that we considered also the sum of the 
series. This latter point of view we shall now place in the fore- 
ground. It is necessary, however, in order to supplement our deve- 
lopments of pp. 78-79 and 105, that we should make it quite clear once 
more what is the significance of the questions which arise in this 
connection. If, for instance, we have proved the relation 122: 

i_i_ L , JL_JL+ 

4 ~ 1 3^5 7 ^ 

we may interpret it in two ways. On the one hand, the equation indi- 
cates that the sum of the series on the right has the value ~ , one 

quarter of the value of a number 1 which we meet with in many other 
connections and to which approximations are well-known. In this 
sense, it may be claimed that we have specified the sum of the series 
written down above. But such a statement can only hold in a very 
relative sense; for it is not possible to give a complete specification 
of the number n, otherwise than by a nest of intervals or some 
equivalent symbol, and such a symbol is precisely furnished by the 
series; i. e. the expression on the right, in the above equation. We 
are therefore equally justified in claiming the exact opposite, namely 
that the equation provides an (extremely simple) expression for the 
number n in series form, that is to say, by means of a conver- 
gent sequence of numbers, which happens indeed in our case to 
have a peculiarly straightforward and convenient form and may also 
(69, 1) be immediately expressed as a nest of intervals 9 . 

The circumstances are entirely altered when we come to the 
equation (cf. 68, 2b): 

1 



1 In former times, when these matters were all interpreted rather geo- 
metrically, -^- was always thought of as the ratio of the area of a circle to 

that of the circumscribed square. 
* Namely: 



- = ( 5 2*| s a*+i)> 



where 



31. Statement of the problem. 231 

Here we are perfectly satisfied with the statement that the sum 
of the series is = 1, precisely because the number 1 (and similarly 
every rational number) can be fully and literally assigned. In such 
cases, we have a perfect right to assert that we have a closed 
expression for the sum of the series. But in all other cases, where 
the sum of the series is not a rational number, or at any rate not 
known to be one 3 , we cannot strictly speak of evaluating the sum of 
the series by means of a closed expression. On the contrary, the 
series ought then to be regarded as a (more or less imperfect) means 
of representing or approximating to its sum. By proceeding to express 
these approximations (usually in the form of decimal fractions) and 
estimating the errors involved, we form what is called a numerical 
evaluation of the sum. 

Lastly, as above in the case of the series for , we may have 

ascertained merely that the given series has for sum a number related 
in some simple (or at any rate specifiable) manner to a number which 
we meet with in other connections; as e. g. it follows from 122 and 
124 that 

1 1 - 3 



In that case, we should still welcome the information so obtained, 
since it establishes a connection between results where formerly we 
saw none. It is usual, in such cases, still to say though in an 
extended sense that we have evaluated the sum by means of a 
closed expression; in fact, the number concerned is then regarded as 
"known" through those other connections, and we simply express the 
sum of the series "by means of a closed expression" involving this 
number. Here the student must, however, guard against self-delusion. 
If it has been ascertained, for instance (v. p. 211) that the sum of the 
series 

i+JL 1 4-L 3 . L + 1 ' 8 ".*.- 1 - L... 

1 ' 2 50 ^~ 2-4 50* "^ 2-4-6 50 3 r 
has the value ^-Vs, it is still only in a very relative sense "deter- 

mined in the form of a closed expression". The number V2 is not 
per se any better known than the sum of any arbitrary convergent 
series. It is only because V2 occurs in so many hundreds of other 
connections and has, for practical purposes, been so often evaluated 
numerically, that we are in the habit of considering its value as almost 
as perfectly "known" as any literally specified rational number. If 

3 For instance, if we have determined the sum of a series to be equal to Euler's 
constant, we do not know to this day whether we are confronted with a rational number 
or not. 



232 Chapter VIII. Closed and numerical expressions for the sums of series. 

instead of the above scries, we consider, for instance, the following 

binomial series: 

_5_ [ 1 , J_ _24 4 24* _4 9 24 1 

2 L 1+ 5 '1000 5-i6" 1000 a " 1 "5-10 15* 1000 s ' " J 



B, _ 



and its sum has been ascertained to be equal to y 100, we shall 
be less inclined to regard the sum as fully determined thereby; on 
the contrary, we shall prefer to accept the series as a most useful 

5 

means of evaluating y 100 to a degree of approximation not so easily 
attainable by other means. In other words, with the exception of 
those few cases in which the sum of a series can be specified as a 
definite rational number, when we consider equalities of the form 
"s = <<*", the emphasis will be laid sometimes on the right hand 
side and sometimes on the left, according to the circumstances of the 
case. If s may be considered as known through other connections, 
we shall still (though in an extended sense) say that the sum of the 
series has been evaluated in the foim of a closed expression. If this 
is not the case, we shall say that the series is a means of evaluating 
the number s (of which it provides the definition). (Obviously both 
points of view may be taken with regard to the same equality.) In 
the former of the two cases, we shall, so to speak, have achieved our 
object, since the problem B (v. p. 105) also is then solved to our satis- 
faction. In the latter case, however, a new task now begins, that of 
actually expressing the approximations, provided by the series itself, 
to its sum, in a convenient and simple form (e. g. in decimal fraction 
form, as the most desirable for our purposes), and of estimating the 
errors involved in these approximations. 

32. Evaluation of the sum of a series by means 
of a closed expression. 

1. Direct evaluation. It is obvious that we may without difficulty 
construct series with any assigned sum. If s be the assigned sum, 
construct, by any one of the many processes at our disposal, a sequence 
( s n) conver gi n g to 5, and consider the series 

*o + (*i - *o) + (*, - O H h (* n s - 1) + ' ' ' 

Since its w th partial sum is precisely = s n , this series is convergent 
and has the sum s. This simple procedure affords an inexhaustible 
means of constructing series capable of summation in the form of a 
closed expression; e.g. we need only assume one of the numerous null 
sequences (a? n ) known to us, and write s n = s x n , n = 0, 1, 2, . ...

7. If we multiply the terms of one of these series by 5, we obtain a 
convergent series of sum s. 

It is not superfluous to be able to construct such examples, as we shall 
see that the power to provide series with known sum is an advantage in 
the discussion of further series. 

The converse of the principle just treated is expressed by the 

Theorem. Given a series Jj a n , whose terms a n are expressible 131, 

in the form a n = x n x n + 1 , where x n is the term of a convergent 
sequence of known limit , the sum of the series can be specified, for 
we have 

^> n = *o-- 

n=0 

Proof. We may write 

Since x n *, the statement follows.

The artifices here employed may be extended to obtain, finally, 
the following considerably further reaching 

134. Theorem. // the terms of a series 2 a n are expressible, for 
every n, in the form

The proof is at once obtained by writing the expressions for

the same vertical. Carrying out the addition in columns, which of 
course is allowed even without reference to the main rearrangement 
theorem we find, for m > k, taking into account the condition ful- 
filled by the coefficients C A , 



which is again the sum of a finite number of terms. Letting m + oo, 
we at once obtain the required relation.

These examples may of course easily be multiplied to any extent desired. 

2 Application to the elementary functions. The above few theo- 
rems have, speaking generally, made us familiar with all types of series 
which may, without requiring any more refined artifices, be summed 
in the form of a closed expression. 

By far the most frequent series, in all applications, are those ob- 
tained by substituting particular values for x in series expansions of 
elementary functions and in series derived from these by every species 
of transformation or combination, or other known processes of deduction. 
Examples, obtained in this manner, of summation by closed expres- 
sions are innumerable. We must content ourselves with referring the 
reader to the particularly ample selection of examples at the end of 
this chapter, in the working out of which the student will rapidly be- 
come familiar with all the main artifices used in this connection. The 
developments in this and the following section will afford further 
guidance in this part of the subject Let us merely observe quite 
generally, for the moment, that it is often possible to deal with a given 
series by splitting it up into two or more parts, each of which again 
represents a convergent series; or else by adding to or subtracting 
from 2 a n > term by term, a second scries of known sum. In particular, 
if a n is a rational function of n its expansion in partial fractions will 
frequently be a considerable help.

Chapter VIII. Closed and numerical expressions for the sums of series. 



3. Application of Abel's theorem of limits. A further means of 
evaluating the sum of a series, one of great theoretical importance, 
differing from that just indicated in the principle it involves, though 
in most cases intimately connected with it in virtue of 101, con- 
sists in applying Abel's theorem of limits. Given a convergent se- 
ries 2 a n , the power series f(x) = 2a n x n converges at least for 
K x <; -f 1, and hence, by 101, 

2a n = hm f(x). 



If we suppose that the function f(x) which the power series represents 
is so far known, that the latter limit can be evaluated, the summation 
of the series is achieved. The developments of Chapter VI offer a 
wide basis for this mode of procedure, and in fact Abel's theorem has 
already been used there more than once in the sense now explained. 
We shall give here only a few relatively obvious examples, with 
a reference to the exercises at the end of this chapter. 

135* Examples. We are already acquainted with the series: 



2. V-_ lim V (-!) = lim 

n^o 2w + 1 *->i-o,o 
We have the further example 



The series inside the bracket has for derived series 

1 



and therefore represents the function (v. 19, Def. 12) 

X 

dx 1 (s+1)* 1 _ l 2x-l n 



Accordingly, the sum ol the given series is = log 2 -f- - 
4. Similarly we find (v. 19, Def. 12) 





For further series constructed on the same lines, the formulae of course become 
more and more complicated. 

4. Application of the main rearrangement theorem. Equally great 
theoretical and practical significance attaches, in our present problem, 
to the application of the main rearrangement theorem. This application 
we proceed at once to illustrate by one of the most important cases; 
additional examples will again be furnished by the exercises. 

In 115 and 117, we obtained two entirely distinct expansions 
of the function xcotx, both valid at least for every sufficiently small \x\. 



32. Evaluation of the sum of a series by means of a closed expression. 237 

If, in the first of these, we replace x by nx, we obtain, certainly for 
every sufficiently small \x\, 



Each term of the series on the right may obviously be expanded in 
powers of x: 

* ^ v o f x \ (k -in i^vptf\ 

t2 "a ~~ 2j * I Taj v 2 i, *> pxea) 
* -x n =i N* / 

These are the series z (fc) of the main rearrangement theorem; 
since the series f (fc) of that theorem in our case only differ in sign 
from the series 2 (fc) themselves, the conditions of that theorem are all 
fulfilled, and we may sum in columns. The coefficient of x 2 ? on the 
right then becomes 

--2J^ (p fixed) 

and since, by 97, it has to coincide with that on the left, we obtain 
the important result (once more denoting the index of summation 
by n)

the case; thus the series 115 has exactly the radius n. It follows from this 

that 116 a has the radius , 116 b the radius n.

It is not superfluous to try to realise all that was needed to obtain 
even the first of these elegant formulae 5 . This will be seen to involve 
much of our investigations up to this point. 

The above provides us with the sum of every harmonic series with 
an even integral exponent; we know nothing yet of the sum of a harmonic 
scries with odd exponent (> 1); that is to say, we have not succeeded 
as yet in finding any obvious relations that might result in connecting 

such a sum fe. g. ^i 3 ) with any numbers occurring elsewhere. (There 

is of course no obstacle to our evaluating the sum of any harmonic series 
numerically, to any degree of approximation 8 ; v. 35). On the other

6 James and John Bernoulli did their utmost to sum the series 



The former of the two did not live to see the solution of the problem, which 
was found by Euler in 1736. John Bernoulli, to whom it became known soon 
after, wrote in this connection (Werke, Vol. 4, p. 22): Atque ita satisfactum est 
ardenti desiderio Fratris mei, qui agnoscens summae huius pervestigationem 
difficihorem quam qms putavent, ingenue fassus est omnem suam industriam fuisse 
elusam . . . Utinam Prater superstes esset ' A second proof, of a quite different 
kind, will be found in 156, a third in 189, and a fourth in 210.

ponent 70, to 32 places of decimals.

Here again, however, we know nothing of the corresponding series

been obtained by starting with the expansions in partial fractions of 

the functions tan or -r- , and reasoning as above for that of the func-

33. Transformation of series. 

In the preceding section ( 32), we became acquainted with the most 
important types of series which can be summed by means of a closed 
expression either in the stricter or in the wider sense of the term. 
In the evaluations last made, which are really of a profound nature, 
the main rearrangement theorem played an essential part; indeed, in 
virtue of this theorem, the original series was changed, so to speak, 
into a completely different series which then yielded further informa- 
tion. We were therefore principally concerned with a special trans- 
formation of series*. Such transformations are frequently of the greatest 
use, and indeed even more so in the numerical calculations which 
form the subject of the following two sections, than in the determina- 
tion of closed expressions for the sums of series. To these trans- 
formations we will now turn our attention, and we start at once with 
a more general conception of the transformation deduced from the 
main rearrangement theorem and repeatedly applied to advantage 
already in the preceding section. 

8 Such transformations were first indicated by /. Stirling (Methodus diffe- 
rentialis, London 1730); they are based, in his case, on similar lines to the 
above, excepting that he fails to verify the fulfilment of the conditions under 
which the processes are valid. 



S3 Transformation of series. 241 

00 

Given a convergent series z (k) , let each of its terms be 

*=o 

expressed, in any manner, (e. g. by 32, p. 232) as the sum of an 
infinite series: 



We shall assume further that the vertical columns in this array them- 
selves constitute convergent series, and denote their sums by 

00 

s (0) , s (1) , . . . , s (n \ .... Under what conditions may the series 2 ^ 

n=0 

formed by these numbers be expected to converge, with 



jfc=0 n-O 

If this equality is justified, we have certainly effected a trans- 
formation of the given series. The main rearrangement theorem im- 
mediately gives the 

Theorem. // the horizontal rows of the array (A) all constitute 141. 
absolutely convergent series and denoting by f (fc) the sum, \ a n ^ |, of 

n=0 

the absolute values of the terms in one row , if the series 2^ is 
convergent, the series 2 s (n) also converges and 2 2 (fe) . 

It is this theorem that we have applied in the preceding para- 
graph. The question arises whether its requirements are not un- 
necessarily stringent, whether the transformation is not allowed under 
very much wider conditions. 

A. In this direction, an extremely far-reaching theorem was proved 
by A.Markoff*. He assumes first only that the series constituted by the 
vertical columns of the array (A) converge, as well as the original series 
and the series constituted by the horizontal rows of the array. The 

GO OD 

numbers s (n) have thus determinate values. Since z* and a^ 

*=0 Jfc=0 

converge, so does J(2 (k) a (fc) ); and also, similarly, for any fixed m, 

A=0 

the series 

2 (*<" - 4" - a? ----- 4LO (m fixed).

St. PStersburg, (7) Vol. 37. 1891). Cf. a note by the author, "Einige Bemer- 
kungen zur Kummerschcn und Markoffschen Reihentransformation", Sitzungs- 
berichte der Berl. Math. Ges., Vol. 19. pp. 417, 1919. 



242 Chapter VIII. Closed and numerical expressions for the sums of series. 

The terms of this series are, however, precisely the remainders, each 
with the initial 10 index m, of the series constituted by the individual rows 
of the array. If, for brevity, we denote these remainders by r^\ so that 

r = 2 a (k and m fixed), 

rt=OT 

the series 

2 r ( * } - R m (m fixed) 

is convergent. The further assumption is then made that 
R m -> when m -> oo. 



It may be shown that under these hypotheses 2sW converges and = 
The theorem obtained will thus be as follows: 

142. Markoff's transformation of series. Let a convergent series 

00 

2 zW be given with each of its terms itself expressed as a convergent series: 

k--o 

(A) *W = V*) + i w + + *n w + - (* = 0, 1, 2, . . .). 

QO 

Let the individual columns 2 a n W of the array (A) so formed represent 

A=O 

convergent series with sum $(">, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , so that the remainders 



of the series in the horizontal rows also constitute a convergent series 

00 

k ^Jm = R m (m fixed). 

In order that the sums by vertical columns should form a convergent series 
Z s("\ it is necessary and sufficient that lim/^ m = R should exist; and in 
order that the relation 

2 s< fl > = 2 zW 

n = A=0 

should hold as well, it is necessary and sufficient that this limit R should be 0. 
The proof is almost trivial, for we have 

(a) > + sW +... + ,00 = R - R n+1 , 

whence the first statement is immediate. Since it follows that 



n=0 



M = R Q -R, 



(to 

and since R is simply 2 r n ) = 2 z^ k \ the second statement now follows 



also. " * =0 



10 Here we of course take m to give the whole series, i. e. z (k) itself. 



33. Transformation of series. 243 

B. The superiority of Markoff's transformation over Theorem 141 
consists, of course, in the absence of any mention of absolute conver- 
gence, only convergence pure and simple being required throughout. Its 
applications are numerous and fruitful: those bearing on numerical evalua- 
tions will be considered in 35, and we shall only indicate in this place one 
of the prettiest of its applications, which consists in obtaining a trans- 
formation given by Euler u of course, in his case, without any con- 
siderations of convergence. 

It is advantageous here to use the notation of the calculus of finite 
differences, and this we will accordingly first elucidate in brief. Given 
any sequence (# , x lt x 2 , .)> tne numbers 



are called the first differences of (x n ) and are denoted by 
A # , A x l9 . . . , A x k9 . . . 

The differences of the first order of (A x n ) 9 i. e. the numbers A x k A x kl , lt 
k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , are called the second differences of (x n ), denoted by 

J 2 * , A*x l9 ..., A*x k , . . 
In general, we write for n ^ 1 

J+* * t = J * fc - J- * &+1 (A = 0, 1, 2, . . .) 



and this formula may also be taken to comprise the case n if we in- 
terpret A" x k as being the number # A itself. It is convenient to imagine the 
numbers x k and A n x k arranged in rows so as to form the following tri- 
angular array, in which each difference occupies the place in its own row 
immediately below the space, in the row above, between the two terms 
whose difference it is: 



Q, X}, % 9 #3, 

Ax Qj Ax lt Ax 2J 
(A) A*x , 



The difference A" x k may be expressed in terms of the given numbers 
x k directly. In fact 

J 2 x k = A x k - A X M = fa - X M ) - 

x k 2 X k+l -f- 

and similarly

143. the formula 

A Xk = x k - (J)* m + (J)* M - + ... + (-D" (J) *<-+ 

for fixed &, is thus established in the cases n = 1, 2, 3. By induction, its 
validity for every n follows. For, supposing 143 proved for a particular 
positive integer n, we have for n + 1 : 



whence by addition, since (j + ( ^j) = ( \ we have the formula 

143 for n + 1 instead of w. This proves all that is required. 

Making use of the above simple facts and notation, we may now state 
the following theorem: 

144. Euler's transformation of series. Given an arbitrary con- 
vergent series 12 

QO 

we invariably have: 

t i \ 7c ^P ^ ^o 

k n-0 2 n+1 ' 

i. e. the series on the right also converges and has the same sum as the given 



12 The series need not be an alternating series, i. e. the numbers a n need not 
all be positive. There are however small, though by no means essential, advan- 
tages in writing the series in alternating form as above, when effecting the trans- 
formation. 

13 This general transformation is due to Ruler (Inst. calc. diff., pp. 281 seq., 
1755). The particular transformation given below in example 2 is to be found 
already in a letter to Leibniz dated 2. 8. 1704, from/. Bernoulli, who attributed the 
discovery to N. Fatzius. (Cf. also J. Hermann, letter to Leibniz of 21. 1. 1705.) 
An early investigation of a more searching kind, using remainder terms, was under- 
taken by /. V. Poncelet, Journ. f. d. reine u. angew. Math., Vol. 13, pp. 1 seq., 1835. 
The proof that the transformation is always valid, provided only the series 2 ( l) fc a k 
is assumed also convergent, was first given by L. D. Ames (Annals of Math., (2) 
Vol. 3, p. 185. 1901). Cf. also E. Jacobsthal (Mathem. Zeitschr., Vol. 6, p. 100. 
1920) and the note bearing on that by the author (ibid. p. 118).

Proof. In the array (A) of p. 211, we substitute for a n (k) : 
(b) a^ = ( - 1)* [ 2 L n A"a k - ^ A- a J .

of the k lh horizontal row), we obtain

is equal to zero by 44, 8, because a ky rt /<,fi> #/cf-2> certainly form 
a null sequence. Accordingly (b) gives an expression for the individual 
terms of the given series S ( I) 1 &L in infinite series. Forming the sum 
of the th column, we obtain the series 



Z(-l) k Ln A n a k ~ - 2 n + i J n+1 <i, 1 (n fixed) ;

the generic term of this series, as J n+1 a k A n a k A n a k+1 , can be written 
in the form

so that the series under consideration may again be summed directly, by 
131. We obtain 

% n (ft) = nVi t jn tf o - Hm ( ~ l) fc J n ^] ( fixed). 

k^O k-^co 

Since, however, the numbers a L form a null sequence, so do the first differ- 
ences and the th differences generally, for any fixed w. The vertical 
columns are thus seen to constitute convergent series of sums 



The validity of Euler's transformation will accordingly be established when 
we have shown th; 
to have the values

If we write for brevity 



this series for R m may be thought of as obtained by term-by-term 
addition from the (m -f- 1) series: 



Hence 



therefore, as r w is the term of a null sequence, so is /? w> by 44, 8. 
This proves the validity of Etilers transformation wilh full generality.

transformation consists simply in subtracting from a given series one

expression and which at the same time has terms as similar in con-

subtracting for instance fiom s = 2,'- t2 the known series (v. 68, 2 b)

CO 1 QO 1 



The advantage of this transformation for numerical purposes is at 
once clear. 

Simple and obvious as this transformation is, it yet forms what 
is really the kernel of Rummer's transformation of series 1 *; the only 
difference being that a particular emphasis is now laid on a suitable 
choice of the series to be subtracted. This choice is regulated as 
follows: Let 2a n = s be the given series (of course, by hypothesis, 
convergent). Let Sc n = C be a convergent scries of known sum C. 
Let us suppose that the terms of the two series are asymptotically 
proportional, say 

lira -.= = 7 4= . 

n-> c >* 

In that case

and the new series occuring on the right may be regarded as a trans- 
formation of the given series. The advantage of this transformation 
lies mainly in the fact that the new scries has terms less in absolute 

value than those of the given series, as in fact (l y ] >Q. Con- 

sequently its field of application belongs for the most part to the do 
main of numerical calculations and examples illustrating it will be 
found in the following paragraph.

is only on very rare occasions that a closed expression, properly so- 
called, exists for the sum of a series. In the general case, the real

248 Chapter VTII. Closed and numerical expressions for the sums of series. 

number to which a given convergent series, or the sequence of num- 
bers for which it stands, converges, is, so to speak, first defined (given, 
determined, . . .) by the series itself, in the only sense in which a number 
can be given, according to the discussion of Chapters I and II 15 . In 
this sense, we may boldly affirm that the convergent series is the 
number to which its partial sums converge. But for most practical 
purposes we gain very little by this assertion. In practice, we usually 
require to know something more precise about the magnitude of the 
number and to compare different numbers among themselves, etc. For 
this purpose, we require to be able to reduce all numbers, defined 
by any kind of limiting process, to one and the same typical form. 
The form of a decimal fraction is that most familiar to us to-day, and 
the expression, in this form, of numbers represented by series accor- 
dingly interests us first and foremost 10 . The student should, however, 
get it quite clear in his own mind that by obtaining such an expres- 
sion we have merely, at bottom, substituted for the definition of a 
number by a given limiting process, a representation by means of 
another limiting process. The advantages of the latter, namely of the 
decimal form, are mainly that numbers so represented are easily com- 
pared with one another and that the error involved in terminating an 
infinite decimal at any given place is easily evaluated. Opposed to 
this there are, however, considerable disadvantages: the complete ob- 
scurity of the mode of succession of the digits in by far the greater 
number of cases and the consequent labour involved in their succes- 
sive evaluation. 

The sc advantages and disadvantages may be conveniently illustrated 
by the two following examples: 

(l -) 1 -i+] -y +-- = 0-785398. .. 
l-i+i--H ----- = 0-693147... 



By the series, distinct laws of formation are given; but they afford us 
no means of recognizing which of the two numbers is the larger of 
the two, for instance, or what is its excess over the smaller number. 
The decimal fractions, on the other hand, exhibit no such laws, but 
give us a direct sense of the relative and absolute magnitudes of 
both numbers. 



15 Indeed an infinite series our previous considerations give ample 
confirmation of the fact is one of the most useful modes of so defining- a 
number, one of the most significant both for theoretical and practical purposes. 

ld And only in special cases the expression in ordinary fractional form. 
The reason is always that of convenience of comparison; which, of -J^ or |$, 
is the larger, we cannot say at once, whereas the answer to the same question 
for 647 and 0-641 requires no calculation whatever. 



34. Numerical evaluations. 249 

We shall therefore henceforth reserve the term numerical eva- 
luation for the expression of a number in decimal form. 

As no infinite decimal fraction can be specified in toto, it will 
be necessary to break it off after a definite number of digits. We 
have still a few words to say as to the significance of this process 
of breaking off decimal fractions. If it be desired, for instance, to 
indicate the number e by a two-digit decimal fraction, we may with 
equal justification write 2' 71 and 2*72, the former, because the two 
first decimals are actually 7 and 1, the latter, because it appears 
to involve a lesser error. We shall therefore make the following con- 
vention: when the n specified digits after the decimal point are the 
actual first n digits of the complete infinite decimal which expresses 
a given number, we shall insert a few dots after the w th digit, writing 
for instance a = 2*71...; when, however, the number is indicated by 
the nearest possible decimal fraction of n digits, we insert no dots 
after the w th digit, but write 17 e. g. e & 2-72, in the latter case the ;i th digit 
written down is thus the w th digit of the actual infinite fraction raised or 
not by unity according as the succeeding part of the infinite fraction re- 
presents more or less than one half of a unit in the w th decimal place. 

In point of fact, cither specification has the effect of assigning an 
interval of length l/10 n containing the required number. In the one 
case, the left hand end point is indicated, in the other, the centre of the 
interval. The margin, for the actual value, is the same in both cases. 
On the other hand, the error attaching to the indicated value, relatively 
to the true value of the number considered, is in the former case only 
known to be I> and _? ]/10 n , in the latter to have modulus 5^ i/10 n . 
We may therefore describe the first indication as theoretically the 
clearer, and the second as practically the more useful. The diffi- 
culty of actual determination of the digits is also in all essential par- 
ticulars the same in both cases. For in either, it may become ne- 
cessary, when a specially unfavourable case is considered, to diminish 
the error of calculation to very appreciably less than 1/10 w before 
the n th digit can be properly determined. If we are, for instance, 
concerned with a number cc = 5-27999999326 ..., to determine 
whether a = 5'27 ... or 5*28 . . . (retaining two decimals), we have 
to diminish the error to less than a unit in the 8 th decimal place. On the 
other hand, if we are concerned with a number /? = 2'3850000026 . . . , 
the choice between /?^2'38 and 2*39 would be influenced by an 
uncertainty of one unit in the 8 th decimal place 18 . 



17 In e = 2-71..., the sign of equality may be justified as representing 
a limiting- relation. 

18 The probability of such cases occurring- is of course extremely small. 
By mentioning them, we have merely wished to draw attention to the signi- 
ficance of these facts. In Kx. 131, however, a particularly crude case is indicated. 



250 Chapter VIII. Closed and numerical expressions for the sums of series. 

2. Evaluation of errors and remainders. When given a conver- 
gent series a n =s, we shall of course assume that the individual 
terms of the series are "known", i. e. that their expressions in decimal 
form can v easily be obtained to any number of digits. By addition, 
every partial sum s n may accordingly also be evaluated. The question 19 
remains: what is the magnitude of the error attaching to a given s n ? 
Here the word error designates the (positive or negative) number which 
has to be added to s w to obtain the required value s. Since this error 
is s s n , i. e. is equal to the remainder of the series, starting im- 
mediately after the n th term, we will denote it by r n , and the process 
of determining this error will also be designated by the term evaluation 
of remainders. 

In practical problems, evaluations of remainders almost invariably 
reduce to one of the two following types: 

A. Remainders of absolutely convergent series. If s = 2 a n con- 
verges absolutely, determine a scries JE a n ' of positive terms, capable 
of summation in a convenient closed expression, and with terms not 
less than the absolute values of the corresponding terms of the given 
series (though also exceeding these by as little as possible). Obviously 



which is assumed known, thus provides a means 
of estimating the magnitude of the remainder r n , i. e. \r n \<^r n ', and 
this all the more closely the less a n ' exceeds \a n \. 

A particularly frequent case is that in which, for some fixed m, 
and every k ^> 1: 

k,, ffc |^|* m -a" with 0<a<l; 

in that case, ot course, 



and in particular, if < a <^ |: 

KJ^KJ. 

The absolute value of the remainder is in this case not greater than 
that of the term last calculated". 

B. Remainders of alternating series. Given a series of the form 
s = 2( l) n # w and supposing that the (positive) numbers a n form 
a monotone (decreasing) null sequence, we have (cf. 82, Theorem 5): 

< _ ln + i r _ fl _ * + _ 



19 Or in more practical form: Up to what order of decimal does s w coin- 
cide with the required value s? 

80 In forming- these estimates, it should be noticed that they give no in- 
dications as to the sign of the remainder r nt only as to its absolute value. 



34. Numerical evaluations. 251 

Hence we may assert that the error r n has the same sign as the first 
neglected term, but has a smaller absolute value. 

When neither of these two modes of procedure is applicable, the 
evaluation of remainders is usually more troublesome, and it becomes 
necessary to adopt special artifices in each particular case. We shall, 
then, designate the series considered as rapidly or slowly convergent, 
according as r n does or does not fall within the desired limit of error 
for moderate values 21 of n. 

A few further fundamental remarks may be elucidated by the 

3. Evaluation of the number e. We found 

^ == iiJ_i_L_fJ__i. |_ JL _L . . . . 

e A ^l!^2! h 3!^ ^ wM 

Already, on p. 194, we have mentioned that the (positive) remainder r n 
was less than the n th part of the term immediately before, so that 

s << s - + sn;- 

In effecting the numerical calculations, we have now to take into ac- 
count the following fact: When we express the individual terms of the 
series in decimal form, we have even at that point to break off the 
decimals at some particular digit, and we therefore incur a certain 
error. Unless n remains comparatively small, these errors may accu- 
mulate to such an extent that the whole calculation is in danger of 
becoming illusory. The mode of procedure is then as follows: Sup- 
posing that we are retaining 9 digits, we write 22 

a + a^ -|- a = = 2-500000000 

a { ~ = 166 666 667" 

4 =--0-. 41 666667" 

0, =0-.. 8 333333+ 

a (} =- 0*.. 1388 889~ 

a 1 0-... 198413- 

8 =-0-.. .24802- 

a 9 =-0- 2756" 

10 =0- 276- 

a^ --() 25 + 

=0- 2+ 

['i, <0' 0+] 

Here the small -f- an( ^ signs are intended to indicate whether the 
error in the term in question is positive or negative. In either case 
it is in absolute value less than one half of a unit in the last decimal 
place. By addition, we obtain the number 

2-718281830. 



21 A more precise definition of rapid convergence will be given in 37. 
82 a n is deduced from <*_! by simple division by n. 



252 Chapter VIII. Closed and numerical expressions tor the sums of series. 

But s 13 itself may possibly (namely if all positive errors are nearly 
and all negative ones nearly } 2 of a unit in the last decimal place) 
fall short of the number required by as much as | of a unit in the 
last decimal place; or it may, on the other hand, be as much as jj of 
a unit in excess, since there are 7 negative and 3 positive errors. 
Taking also into account the remainder, we can only deduce with 
certainty, since s n < e = s n + r n , that 

2-718281826 < e < 2-718281832 . 

Our calculation thus secures only the first seven true decimals, while 
the approximate value 23 is obtained with eight digits: e f^ 2-71828183. 

In practice it will generally suffice to proceed a few decimal places 
further (2 or 3 at most) with the evaluation of the terms than it is desired to 
proceed for the sum. The number n of terms taken into account will be chosen 
so large that the remainder r n contributes at most one unit in the last decimal 
place considered. The error in the individual terms will then, in general, have 
no appreciable effect. But to obtain perfect security for the resulting- digits, 
it is necessary to proceed as described above. For we may retain a large 
number of digits beyond the desired number in calculating the individual terms, 
yet as an error attaches to each of the decimals broken off and these errors 
accumulate, they may, in particularly unfavourable cases (cf. the example 01? 
p. 249), influence some of the much earlier digits 

4. Evaluation of the number yt. The chief means placed at 
our disposal, up to the present, for the evaluation of the number n, 
are the series expansions of the functions tan"" 1 and sin" 1 ; of these, 
the former has the preference, owing to its simple mode of formation. 
From this series, we deduced the expansion 

T w=sl ~~T + T -- 1 ' 

which for numerical purposes is practically valueless. In fact, by 
p. 250, we can say no more on inspection about the remainder r n in 
this expansion, than that it has the sign ( l) n+1 and is in absolute 

value < - - . In order to secure 6 decimals, we should therefore 
& n -f- o 

be obliged to take n > 10 fl , but an evaluation of a million terms is, 
for practical purposes, quite impossible. The rapidity of the conver- 
gence may be increased very materially by Euler's transformation 
144, 2. In the next paragraph, we shall discuss the utility of such 
transformations for purposes of numerical calculation. Our present 
object is to deduce more convenient series expressions for n directly 
from the tan"" 1 series itself. 

The series expansion for tan"" 1 = ~ is already of appreciable

use: this gives

23 Cf. p. 249. 



34. Numerical evaluations. 253 

The following mode of procedure, however, provides considerably more 
convenient series 94 . 
The number 

a = tan * y ^ y ~ 3.53 + 5 . 5 ^ y. 5 7 H 

is easily calculated from the series itself (see below). For this value 
of a, tan a = | , and so 

_ 2 tan a 5 

tan 2 a = - r- =^= TT> 

1 tan- a 1& 

and 

120 



Consequently 4 a exceeds -*- by only a small amount. Writing 

*- J=/, 

we have 

t ^ __ _ism 4_o_--jan * ^L. _ JL 
^ ~ 1-f tan 4 a tan i"w ~~~ 239' 

Hence ft can very easily be evaluated from the series 

~ _, _1 __ JL __ I I , 

p tan 23g - 2 g g 3- 239 3 ^ ' 

The two numbers a and fi give us 



146 ' 



If it be desired to obtain the first seven true decimals of n , we may 
endeavour to attain this end by taking-, say, 9 decimals for each of the terms 
and for the remainder' 26 a scanty enough margin, for the errors incurred 
on the numbers a and ft have ultimately to be multiplied by 16 and 4 respec- 
tively Denoting- the first series by ^i ^ + ^ft -- [-> lne second by 
a/ a 8 ' -{- a 6 ' [- an< * tne corresponding partial sums by s y and s v ', the 
calculation proceeds as follows:

Hence, as the errors change signs in a subtraction, 

Sll = 0- 197 395 559 + + + - 
and 

< fn < 10 10 
Accordingly 

3 158328936 < 1ft a < 3-158328970, 

24 J. Machin (in W.Jones: Synopsis, London 1700). 

26 The result alone can show whether this suffices. In fact we do not know 
a priori whether we are not in the presence of one of the particularly unfavourable 
cases described on p. 249.

254 Chapter VIIT. Closed and numerical expressions for the sums of series. 

for after multiplying by 16 we have to subtract ^=8 units of the 9th deci- 
mal place, or add = 24 of these units, to obtain bounds on either side 
for 16s n . Since 



we have finally to add 2 units to the bound above, to obtain the correspond- 
ing bounds of 16 a. Further 

< = 0004 184 100 + 



*/- a' = 0004 184 076* 
hence 

- 016736307 < - 4 ft < - 0-016736302 . 

Combining the two results, we get 

3-141 592629 < n < 3*141 592668 . 

This brief calculation thus really gives us the seven first true decimals of n\ 

* = 3-141 5926 .. 

(The same procedure would only have secured six decimals for the approxi- 
mate value; cf. calculation of 0, where circumstances, in this respect, were 
the exact reverse) 

The series here utilized for the calculation of n are among the most 
convenient; by their means, a very much greater number of decimals may 
also be secured 28 with relatively small trouble, and we are therefore fully 
justified in regarding n henceforth as one of the ''known" numbers. 

147. 5. Calculation of logarithms. The starting point for the cal- 
culation of logarithms resides in the series 



This series converges with considerable rapidity for x = \, and at 
once gives 



Denoting by , 1 ,..., the terms of the series inside the square 
bracket, we have

26 The number n has been evaluated to 810 places of decimals (Mathematical 
Gazette, Feb. 1948, p. 37). 



34 Numerical evaluations. 255 

Our calculations then proceed as follows, if we again take 9 decimals 
for each of the terms a n - 

a = 0333 333 333+

fl fi -0- ...... 513+ 

-0- ..... 048+ 

a, = 0- ..... 005- 



0346573589 

Whence it follows, taking into account the remainder and the small -+- and 
signs: 

log 2 = 0-693 147 1 ... or log 2 ^ 0-693 147 2 

with seven decimals secured 27 . 

Once log 2 is evaluated, the calculation of the logarithms of all 
other numbers involves very little further trouble. In fact, our senes 

gives, for * = -, 



; 148. 

' 



therefore if log /> is known (/> = 2, 3, . . .), we obtain the value of 
log (p -(- l), by the above formula. Moreover, since ^ - r = , -->> 

the expression involves a series converging very rapidly. In fact 
(cf. above, case p = 1) 



so that the remainder is already very small for quite moderate values 
of n. The rapidity of convergence of course increases when p is 
given somewhat larger values, i. e. as soon as the first few logarithms 
have been successfully determined. It is useful to observe that by 
37, 1, only logarithms of prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, . . . need be 
evaluated; those of all other numbers follow by mere combination. 

Now supposing that we have effected the calculations for the 
logarithms of the first four prime numbers, 2, 3, 5, 7, the labour in. 
volved in calculating the logarithms of further primes is small. Thus, 
for instance, taking p = 10, we have 



with 



11-40' 



27 The series 1 J-f-J }+ for logf 2 is of course inappropriate for 
the evaluation of this number; even its Enler's transformation effected in 144, 1 
is less convenient than the series utilized above.

r < -1 < - *- < - l < *- 
* ^ 7-21 7 11-40 ^ 20 R -2-ll-7 ^ 10-2 D -7 10 ia 

ensuring a degree of approximation sufficient even for the most refined 
scientific needs. 

It would accordingly appear desirable to possess somewhat more con- 
venient methods of calculation for log- 2, log 3, log 5, and also, at any rate, 
log 7. Diverse artifices may be applied for the purpose, all of which consist 

k 

mainly in finding rational numbers , as near as possible to 1, whose 

m 

numerators and denominators are products of powers of these first four primes. 
If q of these primes have been utilized, q fractions will be needed to deduce 
the logarithms of those q primes from those of the fractions. For actually 
effecting these calculations, it is convenient to follow the method indicated 

by Adams**: Evaluate the logarithms of - , ^r, ^- by means, not of the series

25 . / 4 N 4 1 16 1 64 



81 / 1 \ 1 1 1 1 



Owing to the occurrence, in the denominator, of powers of 10, the calculation 
here becomes extremely simple With the aid of these logarithms, we then 
obtain, as may be verified immediately: 



1og2= 71og- -

We have thus, for the actual calculation of natural logarithms, a method which 
is convenient and easily applicable in practice. Into further details of the com- 
putation of logarithmic tables we cannot enter in this place. 

Having obtained log 2 and log 5, we have also the value of log 10; 
and hence, in 

M= I = 0-434 294 48190 .., 

log 10 f 

the "modulus" of Briggs' system of logarithms to the base 10, or 
factor by which the natural logarithm of a number must be multi- 
plied to give the Briggian logarithm 30 . 

6. Calculation of roots. Once logarithms have been mastered 
no great practical importance attaches to the problem of obtaining 
simple methods of calculation for the roots of natural numbers. We 
shall therefore be quite brief in the following explanations. The ra- 
pidity of convergence of the binomial series 



increases as | x \ diminishes. Now the calculation of a power Vq = q p 

i 

can always be reduced to that of a power of the form (l + #) p , with 
some small value of \x\. 

A few examples may serve to illustrate the above. On p. 211, we gave 149. 
for ^/2 the series expansion of FM"?^) : 



^. 1 + 3 4-' 5 . +. 

5 "*" 2 50"*" 2-4 50' jn ~ 2-4-6 50 ^ 
Since ( l) n I *J is constantly positive and forms a monotone decreasing 
quence, the remainder r n may be estimated by means of the inequality 



showing that, even for small values of n, a considerable degree of approxi 
mation is attained* 11 . The method is even more effective if we write 



30 We may remark in passing that we have certainly found ample justi- 
fication, by this time, for what seemed at first the rather arbitrary designation 
of the logarithms with the remarkable base e as the "natural" logarithms.

Since a 2 is chosen to be very near 2, the quantity under the ^/~ is of the form 
1 -\- x t with small \x\. Similarly, if we are already aware that y/3 = 1*732 . .., 
we have only to write 



to obtain, with the greatest ease, an expansion of y/3 to 50 or more places ol 
decimals. 

We may, without further explanation, indicate the examples: 



150. 7. Calculation of trigonometrical functions. The series expansions 

of sinx and cos a; converge with even greater rapidity than the ex- 
ponential series, since only the even or only the odd powers occur 
in them, and these have, moreover, alternating signs. Accordingly, no 
special artifices are required; for angles of no excessive magnitude, 
the series furnish all that can possibly be desired. 

To determine, for instance, sml, we have first to express 1 in 

circular measure. We have 1 = -^r = 0-017453292 . . . , i. e. ccr- 

lou

and the error r n may at once be estimated (p. 250, B) by 



which last expression is already less than ^--lO" 15 f r n = 2. 

Circumstances are similar in the case of cos 1; this quantity may 
also, however, since sin 2 1 < 5^, be obtained easily from the relation

cos 1 = (1 - sin 2 1)* 

by means of the binomial series: tana; and cot a; are then obtained 
by division, or from their expansions 116 and 115, whose conver- 
gence is still quite sufficiently rapid when |a:| is small. 

These latter series also lead to useful expansions for the log- 
arithms of sino; and cosjc, which for practical purposes are of

greater importance than the values of sin x and cos x themselves. We 
have 32 (cf. 19, Dcf. 12)

log tan a; and log cot a; may be obtained from these by simple addition. 
As regards the convergence of these series, we can only state in the 
first instance that they certainly do converge for all sufficiently small 
values of \x\. However, the remarks of p. 237, footnote 4, show further 

that the series in 151 has the radius n y that in 152 the radius ^.

Further details in the computation of trigonometrical tables will 
not be entered into here, as they do not concern the theory of in- 
finite series. 

8. More accurate evaluation of remainders. In the cases pre- 
viously considcied, the sum of a given series was invariably deduced 
by evaluating suitable partial sums and estimating the error involved 
in the corresponding remainder. It is obvious that this method is im- 
practicable unless the convergence of the series is relatively rapid. If 
it be desired to evaluate, with some degree of approximation, for 
instance 

00 1 



this direct method is pretty hopeless 33 . Even if we are very cautious 
in the margin we allow, we can only deduce, as an upper estimate 
of the remainder 



32 The function in the square bracket has to be understood to stand for 

the series 115 after division by x and subtraction of the foremost term . 

x 

The function is therefore defined and continuous also for # = 0. 

33 As we happen to know that the sum is , its evaluation indirectly 

by means of the value of JT is of course quite simple. But for the moment we 
are assuming that we know as little about this sum as e. g. about the sum 



260 Chapter VIII. Closed and numerical expressions lor the sums of series. 
the inequality 



__ ____- 

n (n + 1) ~~ (n + 1) (n + 2) n ' 

according to this, it would become necessary to calculate a million 
terms, in order to secure 6 places of decimals. This of course is out 
of the question. 

This state of things may frequently be improved to some extent, 
if it is possible to supplement the upper estimate of the remainder r n 
by a lower estimate, i. e. to deduce an inequality for r n of opposite sense 
to the above in our case. In our example, the same principle as that 
already used gives 

1 1 _____ 1 

l~ " * " 



we are thus able to assert that our sum s satisfies the conditions 



for every n. To secure 6 decimals, we may accordingly need only 
1000 terms. This is still too large a number for practical purposes. 
But in special examples this method of upper and lower estimates 
of the remainder (cf. Ex. 131) may lead to a satisfactory result. 

These cases are, however, so rare, that they do not come into 
account for practical purposes. Greater importance attaches to methods 
for transformation of slowly convergent into rapidly convergent series, 
because they admit of a far wider range of applications. To these 
methods we proceed to give our attention. 



35. Applications of the transformation of series 
to numerical evaluations. 

In cases of slow convergence, one naturally attempts to change 
the given series into one with a more rapid convergence, by means 
of some suitable modification. We proceed to examine in this light 
the transformations discussed in 33, so as to see how far they will 
be of use to us here. 

A. Kumtner's transformation. For this transformation it is im- 
mediately obvious whether and to what extent an increase in the ra- 
pidity of the convergence can be obtained by it. In fact, using the 
notation of 145, we have 

n=0 n=0 

as (1 r- j *0, the terms of the new series (from some index on-

are, from the first; or in other words, the nearer the terms of 2c n 
are to those of 2 a n - 

Examples. 153

thus here C r- and y = l t and so 



Proceeding 1 in this manner, we obtain, at the />th stage:

The latter series, even for moderate values of p, shows an appreciably rapid 
convergence. 

2. Consider the somewhat more general series 
" 1 f a arbitrary -{= 0, -1, ... 



Here we take 

^n = (w+y)a n -(w-|-l+y)fl nh l, W = 0, 1, 2 ..... 

and we try to determine y (independent of n) so that c n is as near a n as 

possible 34 . Here we have C = y a and a simple calculation gives y ~ - . 

^ p 1 
Hence we obtain 



The expression in the large bracket is

If we now choose y so that the terms in n also disappear, i. e. take y = a-l ^-/> 1 



34 The choice of a number c n of the form x n x n \-\ will, by 131, always 
prove most convenient, as in that case C at any rate may be specified at 
once and the choice still be so arranged that the c n 's are near to the a n 's.

B. Euler's transformation. 

Euler's transformation 144 need not by any means involve an 
increase in the rapidity of convergence 35 of the series to which it is 

applied.

35 The explicit definition of what we mean by more or less rapid con- 
vergence will be given in 37: 2a n ' is said to be more or less rapidly con- 
vergent than 2a n1 according as

in the case of alternating series, the effect need not be an increased 
rapidity of convergence; indeed the following three examples show 
that all conceivable cases may actually occur here:

3. '( If-/* less rapidly convergent series, - - Jj (j-) -

We shall now show, however, that such an increase in the rapi- 
dity of the convergence does result, in the case of those alternating 
series 2(\) n a n , a n > 0, whose terms, though not showing rapidity 
of convergence, still tend to zero in a particular regular manner, which 
we proceed to describe. These are the only types of alternating series 
of any practical importance. 

The hypothesis required will be that not only the numbers a n 
form a monotone decreasing sequence, i. e. have positive first diffe- 
rences A a n , but that the same is true of all differences of every order. 
A (positive) sequence a , fl,,0 2 , ... is said to have p-fold monotony 
if its first, second,..., /> th differences are all positive, and it is said 
to be fully monotone if all the differences J 7c a n , (k, n = 0, 1, 2, . . .) 
are positive. With these designations, the theorem referred to is:

series. 

The proof is very simple. As M+1 ^ a, we have a n ^ # a n .

Further, for the remainder r n of the given series we have 
(~l) n+1 r n = a n ^ - a n+2 + _...= A a n+1 + A a n , 3 + A a M + . ,

that the given series should not converge particularly rapidly. The series will in

On the other hand, as /4 n a A n ' ] a A n a^ ^> 0, the numerators 
of the transformed series also form a monotone null sequence, and 
in particular are all <^ a . Consequently the remainders r n ' of the 
transformed series, which, moreover, is a series of positive terms, 
satisfy 

*n ~~2~*H-~a I" " " " ~ 2 n + 2 \ * 2 4 " 

Consequently, we have 



which proves our statement completely. Further, we sec that the 
larger a is, the greater will be the increase in the rapidity of con-

vergence, i. e. the more rapidly will >0. In particular, we may

transform into series which converge with practically the same rapid- 

(1 \ n 
-g-J , all alternating series for which the ratio of two con- 

secutive terms tends to 1 in absolute value; such series have usually 
a slow convergence. 

Examples. The two most striking 1 examples of Euler's transformation, 

( l} n ( D n 

that of - - '- and s - + > were anticipated in 144. For further appli- 

W -J- 1 Cl Wr j 1 

cations it is essential to know which null sequences are fully monotone. We 
may prove, in this connection, by repeated application of the first mean 
value theorem of the differential calculus ( 19, Theorem 8), the following 
theorem: 

Theorem 2. A (positive) sequence a Q , a^ ... is fully monotone decreasing if 
a function f (x) exists, defined for x ^ 0, and possessing differential coefficients of 
all orders for a;]>0, for which f(n)=a n while the kth derived function has the 
constant sign (- 1)*, (k = 0, 1, 2, . . .). 

Accordingly the numbers 



for instance, form fully monotone decreasing sequences; and from these many 
further sequences of this kind may be deduced, by means of the 

Theorem 3. // the numbers a , a lt ... and b , b l , . . . constitute fully mono- 
tone decreasing sequences, the same is true of the products a Q b Q , a L b L , a^ b , . . . 

Proof. The following formula holds, and is easily verified by induction 
relatively to the index k: 



It shows that, as required, all the differences of (a n b n ) are positive, if those 
of () and (b n ) are so. 

The following may be sketched as a particular numerical example: 

The series

has extraordinarily slow convergence; in fact, it converges with practically as small 
a rapidity as Abel's series 2 1 In (logn) 2 . Yet by means of Eulers transformation, 
its sum may be calculated with relative ease. If we use only the first seven 

terms (to - --- inclusive), we can deduce the first seven terms of the trans- 
\ log lo / 

formed series. If we use logarithms to seven places of decimals, we find, 
with 6 decimals secured, the value 221 840 . . . for the sum of the series 88 . 

C. Markoff's transformation. 

As the choice of the array (A), p. 241, from which Markoffs 
transformation was deduced, is largely arbitrary, it is not surprising 
that we should be unable to formulate general theorems as to the 
effect of the transformation on the rapidity of the convergence. We 
shall therefore have to be content with laying down somewhat wider 
directing lines for its effective use, and with illustrating this by a few 
examples : 

Denoting as before by 2z^ the given series (assumed convergent), 
we choose the terms of the th column in our array (A) to be as 
near as possible to those of the given series, and at the same time 
to possess a sum s (0 ^ which we can indicate by a convenient closed 
expression; this is analogous to the condition of Rummer's trans- 
formation. The series 2(z^ a o^) now certam ty converges more 
rapidly than 2z (1c) ; proceed with this new series in the same way, for 
the choice of the next column in our array, and so on. The effect 
of the transformation will be similar to that of an indefinitely repeated 
Rummer's transformation, the possibility of which was already indi- 
cated in the examples 153, 2 a (cf. Ex. 130). 

00 I 

As an example, we may take the series -~ , which is practically useless 156. 

&=i* 

for the direct evaluation of its sum -. Here we think of the th row and 

b 

column as consisting entirely of noughts, which we do not write down The 

choice of the series 5] -- for the first column, which was already used 
K (K -f- 1) 

on p. 247, then appears obvious enough. This gives 

2? <.-.,*) -2* 



As second column, we shall then, as in 153, 1, choose the series 



and so on. The k ih row of the array thus takes the form 
1 _ 0! _ ___ ![_ _ __ 2! __ 

/e 3 " k (k+ 1) + k (k + 1) (k + 2) + k (k + 1) (k f- 2) (k + 3) + ' ' ' (k hxcd) ' 

The further calculations are, however, simplified by breaking off this series at 
the (k l) th term and adding as # h term the missing remainder r k , after 



38 This example is taken from the work of A. A. Markoff: "Differenzen- 
rechnung", Leipzig, p. 184. 1890.

now has the form:

we easily find

Since all the terms of this array arc g> 0, the main rearrangement 
theorem OO itself shows that we may sum in columns and must obtain - as 
ultimate result. Now in the n tb column we have the series

By 132,3 for a = n+l and /?--=M, the series in the square brackets has 
the sum 1

Therefore we have 



This formula is significant not only for numerical purposes, in view oi 
the appreciable increase in the rapidity of the convergence, but almost more 
so because it provides a new means of obtaining the closed expression for the 

sum of the series , which we only succeeded in determining indirectly

by using the expansion in partial fractions as well as the series expansion of 
the function cot. In fact we can easily establish directly (cf. Ex. 123), that 
123 implies the expansion, for | x \ < 1 :

A further application of fundamental importance of Markoffs transforma- 
tion we have already come across (v. 144) in Euler's transformation, which 
was indeed deduced from Markoffs. 

For further applications of Markoffs transformation we must refer to the 
accounts of Markoff himself (v. p. 265, footnote 38) and of E. Fabry (The'orie des 
series & termes constants, Paris 1910). Their success depends for the most 
part on special artifices, but they are sometimes surprisingly effective. Nu- 
merous examples will be found, completely worked out, in the writings re- 
ferred to.

Development of the theory. 

Chapter IX. 
Series of positive terms. 

36. Detailed study of the two comparison tests. 

In the preceding chapters we contented ourselves with setting 
forth the fundamental facts of the theory of infinite series. Henceforth 
we shall aim somewhat further, and endeavour to penetrate deeper 
into the theory and proceed to give more extensive applications. For 
this purpose we first resume the considerations stated from a quite 
elementary standpoint in Chapters III and IV. We begin by examin- 
ing in greater detail the two comparison tests of the first and second 
kinds (7 and 73), which were deduced immediately from the first 
main criterion (70), for the convergence or divergence of series of 
positive terms. These, and all related criteria, will in the sequel be 
expressed more concisely by using the notation 2c n and 2 d n to de- 
note any series of positive terms known a priori to be convergent 
and divergent respectively, whereas 2a n shall denote a scries 
alsoy in the present chapter, of positive terms only whose con- 
vergence or divergence is being examined. The criterion 73 can then 
be written in the simple form 

157. (Ij a n <:c n : ' <B, a n ^d n : <3>. 

This indicates that, if the terms of the series under consideration 
satisfy the first inequality from and after a certain n, then the series 
will converge] If, on the other hand, they satisfy the second inequality, 
from and after a certain n, then it must diverge. 

The criterion 73 becomes in the same abbreviated notation 



158. (H) ^ : , 



n 



Before proceeding we may make a few remarks in this connexion. 
But let us first insist once more on one point: Neither these nor any 



274 



36. Detailed study of the two comparison tests. 275 

of the analogous criteria to be established below will necessarily solve 
the question of convergence or divergence of any particular given 
series. They represent sufficient conditions only and may therefore 
very well fail in special cases. Their success will depend on the 
choice of the comparison series 2c n and 2 ' d n (see below). The fol- 
lowing pages will accordingly be devoted to establishing tests, as 
numerous and as efficacious as possible, so as to increase the pro- 
bability of actually solving the problem in given special cases. 

Remarks on the first comparison test (157). 159. 

1. Since for every positive number g the series 2gc n and 2gd n 
necessarily converge and diverge respectively with 2c n and 2 d n , the 
first of our criteria may also be expressed in the form: 

5^*(<+oo) : , >g(>0) : S> 
or, even more forcibly, in the form 

hm ?- < -f oo : S, lim^>0 : S>. 

c n a n 

2. Accordingly we must always have: 

hm == + oo , lim - "- = 

c n 

or, otherwise expressed: 

lim- a *== -[-oo is a necessary condition for the divergence of ~fl w , 

lim " = necessary n n w convergence 2& n * 

3. Here, as in all that follows, it is not necessary that actual 
unique limits should exist. This may be inferred, to take the question 
quite generally, from the fact that the convergence or divergence of 
a series of positive terms remains unaltered when the series is sub- 
jected to an arbitrary rearrangement (v. 88). The latter can in every 
case be so chosen that the above limits do not exist. For instance 
2c n can be taken to be 1 + + 5 +" J ~K* * "> anc * ~ a n to ^ e ^ le se " cs 

2 + l + 8+4~l~82~l~l6H ' 

obtained from the former by interchanging the terms in each successive 
pair; the ratio certainly tends to no unique limit; in fact, it has 

c n 

distinct upper and lower limits 2 and |. Similarly, let 2 d n be chosen 
to be the series 1 + | + | + | + ***, and let 2a n be the series 



276 Chapter IX. Series of positive terms. 

deduced from the former by rearrangement, (in this series every two 
odd denominators are followed by one even one). Here ~ has the 

two distinct upper and lower limits | and |. In a similar manner we 
may convince ourselves by examples in the other cases that an actual 
unique limit need not exist. //, however, such an unique limit does 
exist, it necessarily satisfies the conditions indicated for lim and lim, 
since it is then equal to both. 

4. In particular: No condition of the form -^ is necessary 

for the convergence of 2a n unless all the terms of the divergent 
series 2 d n remain greater than a fixed positive d. For, even if we 
only have lim d n = 0, by choosing 

so that 



and writing a h = d k , a n = or = the corresponding term c n of any 
convergent series c n for every other n, we evidently obtain a convergent 
series a n , but it is equally evident that -~ does not >0. 

160. Remarks on the second comparison test (158). 

1. The validity of the comparison test II may now be established 
more concisely as follows: 

In the case marked (G), we have, from and after a definite n, 

_!L^>.JL f i. e. (--) is a monotone descending sequence, whose limit 

c n c + i \ c nJ 

y is defined and ^ 0. In particular lim = y < + oo, and, by 159, 1, 

2a n is convergent In the case marked (3)), K* J is monotone ascend- 
ing from and after a particular n, and accordingly also tends to a 
definite limit > 0, or to -\-oo. In either case the condition lim -, n - > 

n 

of 159, 1 is fulfilled and this shows that 2a n is divergent 

2. The comparison test II thus appears as an almost immediate 
corollary to the comparison test I. If the convergence or divergence 
of a series 2 a n can be inferred by comparison with a (definitely 
chosen) series 2c n or Sd n in accordance with 158, then this may 
also be inferred by means of 157 (or 159, 1), but not conversely, 
i. e. if I is decisive, II need not be so. 

Examples of this have already occurred in the pairs of series of 
159, 3. For the first pair we have lim = 2, while ^ alter-

natelv ~ 2 and -= --, i. e. it is sometimes greater, sometimes less than the 

o 

corresponding ratio JL * Li , since this constantly = ~. The second 

C n 6 

pair of series represents an equally simple case. 

3. This relation between the two types of comparison tests be- 
comes particularly interesting when we come to deal with the two tests 
to which we were led in 13 as immediate applications of the first 
and second comparison tests. These \\ere the root and ratio tests, 
inferred from I and II by the use of the geometric scries as com 
parison series, and they may be stated thus: 

,-(^*<l : <S 
: 3) 

Our remark 2. shows that the ratio test may very well fail when the 
root test applies (the series 2 a n given there are obvious examples of 
this). On the other hand our remark 1. shows that the root test must 
necessarily work, if the ratio test does so. This relation between the 
two comparison tests is expressed in more significant form by the 
following theorem, which may be regarded as an extension of 43, 3.

Proof. The inner inequality is obvious 2 , and the two outer in-

is nothing to prove. But, if // < -f- oo, we may, given e > 0, assign 
an integer p, such that, for every v ^> p, we always have

implying that in the centre, either lim or lim may be considered indifferently. 
Such an abbreviated notation will frequently be used by us in the sequel.

This inequality may be supposed written down for every v ~ f> , 
p -f- 1, . .., n 1, and we then multiply all these inequalities together, 
deducing, for n > p,

But V0f-*l, and hence (// + -0 %A -> p' + ~ . We can therefore 

so choose n >p that, for every n>n n , we have f// + ~J \ A < /i' + 6. 
We then have a fortiori, for every n > n , 



and hence also /i < // + e, or, as asserted, since e is arbitrary, /i <[ /e r . 
(Cf. p. 68, footnote 10.) Moreover we can show by simple examples 
that the sign of equality need not hold in any of the three inequalities 
of 161, which is now completely established. 

4. The preceding theorem shows in particular that, if lim ~ 



n 




exists, lim yx n must also exist and have the same value. Hence in 

particular: If the ratio test works in the form given in 76, 2, then so 
will the root test, necessarily, (but not the converse!). To sum up: 
The ratio test is theoretically less powerful than the root test. (Never- 
theless it may frequently be preferred, as being easier of application.) 
5. In this place we have also to refer to the remarks 75, 1 
and 76, 3. 

37. The logarithmic scales. 

We have already observed that such criteria as those just dis- 
cussed only provide sufficient conditions and may accordingly fail Li 
particular cases. Their efficiency will depend on the nature of the 
chosen comparison series 2c n and 2d n ; in general terms we may 
say that a G-test will present a better prospect of success the greater 
the magnitude of the c n 's, a 3) -test, on the contrary, the smaller the 
magnitude of the ^ n 's. In order to express these circumstances more 
precisely, we proceed first to define the concept of the rapidity of 
convergence: A convergent series will be said to converge more or 
less rapidly according as its partial sums approach more or less ra- 
pidly to the sum of the series; and a divergent series will be said to 
diverge more or less rapidly in proportion to the rapidity with which 
its partial sums increase. More precisely: 



37. The logarithmic scales. 279 

Definition 1. Given two convergent series 2c n = s and c n ' = s ' 
of positive terms, whose partial sums are denoted by s n and s n ', the 
corresponding remainders by s s n = r n , s's n ' = r n ', we say that 
the second converges more or less rapidly (or better or less well) 
than the first, according as 

lim^ = or lim-?'=+oo. 

r n r n 

If the limit of this ratio exists and has a finite positive value, or 
if it be known merely that its lower limit > and its upper limit 
< -f-cx), then the convergence of the two series will be said to be 
of the same kind. In any other case a comparison of the rapidity of 
convergence of the two series is impracticable 3 . 

Definition 2. // 2 d n and 2d n ' are two divergent series of posi- 
tive terms, whose partial sums are denoted by s n and s n ' respectively, 
the second is said to diverge more or less rapidly (or more or less 
markedly) than the first according as 

s ' s ' 

lira = + oo Of lim - - = 0. 

, ^ *n 

If the upper and lower limits of this ratio are finite and positive, 
then the divergence of both series will be said to be of the same kind. 
In any other case we shall not compare the two series in respect of 
rapidity of divergence 4 . 

The two following theorems show that the rapidity of the con- 
>ergence or divergence of two series may frequently be recognised 
from the terms themselves (without reference to partial sums or re- 
mainders): 

c ' 
Theorem 1. // -^- *0(+ oo), then 2c n ' converges more (less) 

rapidly than 2c n . 



Y / r / 

8 In the case lim - - = (> 0) and lim < -f oo (= + OO), we might also 

speak of the series 2c n ' as "no less" ("no more") rapidly convergent than the 
series S c n \ this however presents no particular advantages In the case of the 
lower limit being and the upper limit -}-OO, the rapidity of the conver- 
gence of the two series is totally incommensurable. A similar remark holds 
for divergence. (The student should illustrate by examples the fact that all 
the cases mentioned can really occur.) These definitions may be directly 
transferred to the case of series of arbitrary terms, replacing r n and r n ' by 
their absolute values. 

4 The properties referred to in these definitions are obviously transitive^ 
i. e. if a first given scries converges more rapidly than a second, and this 
again more rapidly than a third, the first series will also converge more ra- 
pidly than the third. 



280 Chapter IX. Series of positive terms. 

Proof. In the first case, given e, we choose n so that for every 
n > n n we have cj < . We then also have 

\t n n 



',i c + i + c 

Consequently this ratio tends to 0. The second case reduces to the 
first by interchanging the two series (cf. the theorem of 40, 4, Rem. 4). 
This proves all that was required. 

Theorem 2. // -,- *0(-{~oo), then 2d n ' diverges less (more) 
rapidly than 2 d n . 

Proof. By 44,4 it follows immediately from -j~ *0 that 



This proves the statement.

are such that each converges more rapidly than the preceding 1 . In fact we 
have e. g. for n > 3 :

which tends to 0. Similarly -- -> (by 38,4); the other cases are even

simpler. 

2. The series 

1 7 ~ 



- 
are such that each diverges less rapidly than the preceding. 

Besides the above simple examples, the most important cases of 
series with rapidity of convergence forming a graduated scale are 
afforded by the series which we came across in 14. As we saw in 
that paragraph, the series 



y 

~~ / 



M) a 



converge for a > 1 and diverge for a < 1 . Our theorems 1 and 2 now 
show more precisely that when p is fixed each of these series will 
converge or diverge less and less rapidly as the exponent a approaches 
unity (remaining > 1 in the first case and <^ 1 in the second). Simi- 
larly each of these series will converge or diverge less and less ra- 



37. The logarithmic scales. 281 

pidly, as p increases, whatever positive 5 value may be given to the ex- 
ponent a (> 1 in the first case, < 1 in the second). 

The second alone of these statements perhaps requires some justi- 
fication. Divide the generic term of the (p + l) th series with the ex- 
ponent a' by the corresponding term of the /> th series taken with the 
exponent a. We obtain 



In the case of divergent series, a, and ef are positive and ^1; the 
ratio therefore tends to 0, q e. d. In the case of convergence, i. e. a 
and a! both > 1, the ratio tends to -f- oo; in fact, by reasoning 
analogous to that of 38, 4, we have the auxiliary theorem that 
the numbers 

(loRp Kn ^ {log(lo gj> n)} flf 
(\og p nf (log p nf 

form a null sequence, /? = a 1 denoting any positive exponent and 
p any positive integer. This proves all that was required. 

The gradation m the rapidity of the convergence and divergence 
of these series enables us to deduce complete scales of convergence 
and divergence tests by introducing these series as comparison series 
in the tests I and II (p. 274). We first immediately obtain the fol- 
lowing form of the criteria:

These criteria will be referred to briefly as the logarithmic tests 
of the first and second kinds also in the case p = Q. Their effi- 
ciency may be increased by the choice of p, and, for fixed p, by the 
choice of a, in accordance with our previous remarks 6 . 



* For a = /?<0, each series of course diverges more rapidly than the 
preceding one with the exponent replaced by 1; thus e. g. ^ & ~ , with 

/?>>0, diverges more rapidly than JSJ' 

e The convergence and divergence of series of the above type was known 
to N. H. Abel in 1827, but was not published by him (CEuvres II, p. 200). 
A. de Morgan (The differential and integral calculus, London 1842) was the first 



282 Chapter IX. Series of positive terms. 

For practical purposes it is advantageous to give other forms of these criteria. 
Such transformations are given below with a few remarks appended, but without 
completely carrying out the necessary calculations. 

Transformation of the logarithmic tests of the 1 st kind. 

1. When a and b are positive, the two inequalities a ^ b and log a 5C log & 
are equivalent; after a slight alteration the inequalities 164, I accordingly become: 

logan -f log** + Iog 2 n !- + logyn i <; - p < : <o 
( } log^ \^0 : S5. 

2. Denoting for a moment by A n the expression on the left of (I'), we have, 
in 

(I") hm A n < : <2 , Km ^ n > : >, 

a test of practically the same effect. The parts relating to convergence are indeed 
completely equivalent in (I') and (I"); that relating to divergence is not quite 
so powerful in (I") as in (I'), since it is required in (I") that A n should remain, 
from some value of n onwards, not merely = but greater than a fixed positive 
number 7 . 

3. If we use the somewhat more explicit notation A n A ( \ and consider 
both A ( * } and A** l) , we obviously have 

A (p fl) = 1 



And since, by 38, 4, g ~ - = - -~^ - - tends as n increases to -f oc , this simple 
'\og v+1 n log(logj,w) 

transformation leads to the following result: If for a particular p one of the limits 
of A n A ( * } is different from zero, it is necessarily oo for the following p, in fact 
+ oc or GO according as the preceding p was positive or negative. More pre- 
cisely, if we denote by fi p and x v the upper and the lower limits of A n A ( \ for 
every p t then if we have, for any particular />, 

x p ^ /i p < 0, we have x^ -= n v+1 == oo, 
and if 

Pj> ^ * P > 0, we have //+, = x,, +1 == + oo. 

If, however, 

XP < 0, n p > 0, we have x p+l = oo, fi p+ i = -f oo. 

The scales of reference (I) thus lead to the solution of the question of conver- 
gence or divergence if, and only if, for a particular p, the values y. p and ^ 
have the same sign. If the sign is negative, the series converges; if positive, it 



to use these series for the construction of criteria. Essentially, these criteria are 
consequences of 164, I and II; numerous transformations of them were subse- 
quently published as special criteria, e. g. by/. Bertrand (]. de math, pures et appl., 
(1) Vol. 7, p. 35. 1842), O. Bonnet (ibid., (1) Vol. 8, p. 78. 1843), U. Dini (Giornale 
di matematiche, Vol. 6, p. 166. 1868). 

7 It would clearly, however, be wrong to write the last 25-test in the form 
Hm A n ^ 0, since the lower limit may very well be without a single term being 
positive. 



37. The logarithmic scales. 283 

diverges ; if the two numbers have opposite signs for some value of p, then for 
all higher />'s we have 



and the scale therefore is not decisive. Similarly it fails when both numbers are 
zero for every p. 

Transformation of the logarithmic tests of the 2 nd kind. 

1. The following Lemmas are easily proved: 

Lemma 1. For every integer p ^ 0,/or every real a and every sufficiently large 
, an equality of the form 

/log,, (/i_- 1)\ ^ 1 ____ a ____ * n 
\ log,, n ) ' w log w ... log,, n ri l 

holds, where ( n ) is bounded 8 . The index n is here assumed to start with a value from 
and after which all the denominators are defined and positive. 

We immediatelv infer that, for every integer p ^ 0, for every real a and every 
sufficiently large n, 

} l l^jrl^J- 11. (]2?f ^ "JlV* 
logn "* log^^n \ log p n j 



n wlogn n logti . . . log f ,_ 1 n log n . . . log^ti w 2 

where (/) is again certainly bounded 9 . 

Lemma 2. Let 2 a n and 2 a n f be two series of positive terms; if the series 
whose n^ term is 

4. , aJ 



ts absolutely convergent, the two given series are either both convergent or both 
divergent. 

In fact, we have yv> 1 for every v\ taking, then, any positive in- 
teger m, writing down the relations 



for j/ = m, m-fl, ..., w 1, and multiplying them together, we at once de- 
duce that the ratio *'/ for n > m lies between two fixed positive numbers. 



8 An equality of the above form of course holds under any circumstances. 
In fact we can consider the numbers # n as defined precisely by the equation: 



n log n . . . log p n 

The emphasis lies on the statement that (<?) is bounded. The proof is ob- 
tained inductively, with the help of the two remarks that if (#') and (#") are 
defined, for every sufficiently large n, by 

(1 x n ) a 1 a x n $,/ a; n a and Ic 

they are necessarily bounded, provided (#) is a null sequence and the num- 
bers y n are in absolute value |> 1 , say. 

The interpretation in the case p is immediately obvious. 



284 Chapter IX. Series of positive terms. 

The conditions of the Lemma are fulfilled, in particular, when the ratios -"-i* 



and -^-~ lie between fixed positive bounds and the series J 

converges. 

2. In accordance with the above we may express the logarithmic test of 
the second kind e. g. in the following form 10 : 



n n log w nlog/t ... log p __itt n log n... 



'<! 

or, after a simple transformation, 



169. |f!iI_i-|--L-| ---- -f._ - L- -- l-wlogw ...log.n 

L M n ' ' n log n . . . log nj e "1* 



< 



or, finally, denoting the expression on the left hand side for brevity by /? n , 
and slightly restricting the scope of the 3) -test (cf. 165,2), 

Tim'B w <0 : <5, }^_B n >Q : 3). 

Remarks analogous to those of 165, 2 hold here. 

3. The developments of 165, 3 also remain valid, with quite unessential 
alterations. For, if we use the more explicit notation B n B^\ we have ob- 
viously 



And, as log ;j + 1 n 4-OO, we may reason with this relation in precisely the 
same manner as with its analogue in 165, 3. It is unnecessary to develop this 
in detail. 

4. Still more generally, we may at once prove that a series of the form 



^ e (a ~ 1)n . n a (log n) ai (Iog 3 n) a . . . (Iog 7 n) a * 

converges '/ and only if, the first of the exponents a, a , a,, . . . , a q which 
differs from 1 is > 1. The values of the subsequent exponents have no further 
influence. When the comparison scries is put into this form, Raabe's test 
( 38) and Cauchy's ratio test appear naturally as the th and the ( l) th terms 
of the logarithmic scale. 

38. Special comparison tests of the second kind. 

The logarithmic tests deduced in the preceding article are un- 
doubtedly of greater theoretical than practical interest. They afford in- 
deed a more profound insight into the systematic theory of the con- 
vergence of series of positive terms, but are of little use in actually 
testing the convergence of such series as occur in applications of the 

10 Here we make the n th term of the investigated series 2'a n correspond 
to the (n l) th term of the comparison series, which, by 82, theorem 4, is 
allowable. 



38. Special comparison tests of the second kind. 285 

theory. (For this reason we have only sketched the considerations 
relating to them.) For practical purposes the first two or three terms, 
at most, of the logarithmic scales may be turned to account; from 
these we proceed to deduce by specialization a number of simpler 
tests, which were discovered at various times, rather by chance, and 
each proved in its own way, but which may now be arranged in 
closer connexion with one another. 

For p = the logarithmic scale provides a criterion already estab- 
lished by /. L. Raabe 11 . We deduce it from 169, first in the form 

: - ft < o : e 



or, as we may now write more advantageously, 

> 1 : s>. 17 - 

The tfery elementary nature and great practical utility of this cri- 
terion makes it worth while to give a direct proof of its validity: the 
(^-condition means that, for every sufficiently large n, 

where ft = a 1 > 0. Hence 



and therefore w n + 1 is the term of a monotone descending sequence, 
for a sufficiently large n. Since it is constantly positive, it tends to 
a limit y ^ 0. The series 2c n with c n = (n 1) a n n a n + 1 there- 

fore converges, by 181. Since a n <^ ~gC n , the convergence of 

S a n immediately follows. Similarly, if the -condition is fulfilled, 
we have 



- or n- 



Accordingly w# n + 1 is the term of a monotone increasing sequence 
and therefore remains greater than a fixed positive number y. As 

+ !> , y > 0, the divergence follows immediately. 

If the expression on the left in 170 tends, when n *+(X>, to 
a limit I, it follows from the reasoning already repeatedly applied 
(v. 76, 2) that / < 1 involves the convergence of 2a n > and I > 1, 
its divergence, while / = 1 leads to no immediate conclusion.

286 Chapter IX. Series of positive terms. 

Examples. 

1. In 25 we examined the binomial series and were unable to decide 
there whether the series converged or not at the endpoints of the interval of 
convergence, that is, whether for given real as the series 

.4:0 - .!<-"(:) 

were, or were not, convergent. We are now able to decide this question. 
For the second series we have 



__ 
a ~ n + 1 ~ n-f-1 

Since this ratio is positive from a certain stage on, it follows that the terms 
then maintain one sign; this we may assume to be the sign -}-, since changing the 
signs of all the terms does not, of course, affect the argument. Further, ac- 
cording to this, 



from which we at once deduce, by Raabe's test, that the second of our series 
converges for a>0, and diverges for -<0. For a = 0, the series reduces 
to its initial term 1. 

For the first series we have 



and, since this value becomes negative from some stage on, the terms of the 
seja^shave an alternating sign from that stage on. If now we supple a- " ^ " 
we^lhefore have 




>1 



whenW we inllr'that ultimately the terms a n are non-decreasing. The series 
must therefore^diverge. If however we suppose a-f- 1 > 0, we have ultimately, 
say for every n^>m t 9 



and the terms ultimately decrease in absolute value. By Leibniz's criterion for 
series with alternately positive and negative terms, our series must therefore 

converge, provided we can show that ( j-*0. If we write down the rela- 

tions (a) for m, m-\-\, ..., n l and multiply them all together, we deduce 
for every n ;> m 

l-ll|- II f 1 - 



Since, however, the product Jf (l " j , by 126, 2, 3, diverges to 0, a n must 

also ^0, and theref6re I J must converge. Summing up, we therefore 

have the following results relating to the binomial series: 

00 /cc\ 
The series J ( ) x n converges if, and only if, either | * | <; 1 , or x = 1 

n=o \ w ^ 



38. Special comparison tests of the second kind. 287 



and a > 12 , or x = +1 and a > 1. The sum of the series is then by Abel's theorem 
of limits always (1 -f #) a . // a is an integer and is non-negative \ then the series is finite 
and hence converges for each x. In all other cases the series is divergent. (An appreciable 
addition to this theorem is provided by 247.) 

2. The following criterion docs not differ essentially from that of Raabe; 
it is due to O. Schlomilch : 



- 1 i 

In fact, in the case ($), we have, by 114, n+l ^ e > 1 , 

a n w 

from which the divergence follows by Raabe's test. In case (6) we have, 
ultimately, 



if a >a'>l. By 170, this involves convergence. 

If, in the logarithmic scale, we choose p = 1, we obtain a cri- 
terion of the second kind which, omitting the limiting case cc = 1, * 
we may write 

with 171. 



A direct proof of the validity of this criterion can be given as 
follows As in the proof of Raabes test we first put the criterion in 
the following form: 

// now the G- condition is fulfilled} since, as we may immediately 
verify by 114, a, * 

(n - l)log(n - 1) > - 1 + (n - l)logn, 
we have a fortiori 

Accordingly wlogna M + 1 is the term of a monotone descending se- 
quence and accordingly tends to a limit y^O. By 131, the series 
whose n ih term is 



must converge. As a n ^>-jC n , the same is true of 2a n . 

If, on the other hand, the 3)- condition is fulfilled, we have 
(n l)log(w !) nlogn-a n + a 



. 
For w>4-oo, however, the expression in square brackets -* (I* 



12 For a = 0, see above 



Chapter IX. Series oi positive terms. 

(by 112, b), and is therefore negative for every sufficiently large n 
Hence for those w's the expression ttlogn*0 n+1 increases monotonel> 
and consequently remains greater than a certain positive number y 

As a ., ^- , y > 0, it follows that 2 a must diverge. 

n -r i - w Jog- w ' n 

Here again we may observe, as repeatedly in previous instances, 
that, if a n tends to a limit /, then / > 1 involves convergence, and 
/ < 1 involves divergence, while, from / = 1, nothing can be directly 
inferred. 

Even this, the first properly logarithmic criterion of the scale, will 
rarely be actually applied in practice. In fact, the scries which are 
amenable to this test, and not already to a simpler one (Raabe's test, 
or the ratio test), occur exceedingly seldom; and as their convergence 

is no more rapid than that of 3J -- , (a>l), these series are 

M (lOg W) a 

useless for numerical calculation. 

It enables us, however, to deduce easily one or two other cri- 
teria. We will above all mention 



172. Gauss's Test 18 : // the ratio ^^ can be expressed in the form 



where I > 1, and (?? n ) is bounded*-*, then 2 a n converges when a>l 
and diverges when cc < 1 . 

The proof is immediate: when a^l, Raabe's test itself proves 
the validity of the assertion. For cc = 1, we write 



a n n n log n \ 

and as now the factor in brackets tends to zero since (A 1) > 0, 
the series certainly diverges, by 171.

follows: "// the ratio -~^ can be expressed in the form

which shows in the first instance that the series converges (absolutely) for 
j#|<Clj an d diverges for|sc|>l. Accordingly it only remains to examine 
the values x 1 and x = 1 . This is analogous to the case of the binomial 
series, to which, of course, the present one reduces when we choose ft = y (= 1) 
and replace a and x by a and x. 
For x = 1 , we have 

n+l **+ 



This shows that for every sufficiently large w, the terms of the series have 
one and the same sign, which may be assumed positive. Gauss's test now shows 
that the series converges for + /ff y 1 < 1, i.e. for a + /?<y, but di- 
verges for cc -f- ft ^> y 

For a? = 1, the series has, from some stage on, alternately positive and 

negative terms, since *** + i -> 1 , i. e. is ultimately negative. The relation 18 



with word for word the same reasoning as was employed in 170, 1 for the 
binomial series, now shows that the hypergeometric series will 

diverge when a + ft y > 1 
converge when a + ft y < 1 . 

We have only to verify further that it also diverges when cc + ft y 1 , 
as this does not follow from precisely the same reasoning as before. If for 
every n > p >- 1 we have

Since on the right hand side we have the product of the first (n p) factors of 
a convergent infinite product of positive factors, it follows that |a n |, for all 
these values of n, remains greater than a certain positive number. The series 
can therefore only diverge. 



15 For these values, the series would terminate or become meaningless. 
For w = 0, the general term of the series should be equated to 1.

application to a fresh deduction of the logarithmic scale 

of comparison tests. 

Our previous manner of deducing the logarithmic tests invests 
these, the most general criteria yet obtained, with something of a for- 
tuitous character. In fact everything turned on the use, as comparison 
series, of Abel's series, which were obtained themselves only as chance 
applications of Cauchy's condensation test. This character of fortuitous- 
ness disappears to some extent if we approach the subject from a 
different direction, involving a greater degree of inevitablencss. Our 
starting point for this is the following

by 81,2, the series 2 a n must accordingly diverge when = 1, and 
a fortiori when a<^l. 

The proof of its convergence in the case a > 1 is slightly more 
troublesome. We may at the same time prove the following extension, 
clue to Pnngsheim.

all positive, it would also suffice to establish the inequality

(1 - x) = (1 - )(! + x + + a;"- 1 ). 
Therefore the theorem is established. 

Additions and Examples. 175. 

1. In the theorem of Abel-Dmi, we may of course replace the quantities 
D n by any other quantities D n ' asymptotically equal to them, or for which the 

D ' 
ratio ~ lies between two fixed positive numbers, for every n (at least from 

some stage on). By 70,4 the convergence or divergence of the series 2 a* 
cannot be affected by this change. 

2. By the theorem of Abel-Dim, 

v j t . v d n

diverges with 2 d n . We may enquire what is the relation as to magnitude 
between the partial sums of the two series. Here we have the following elegant

The undefined number D we here assume = 1, also replacing the above ratio 
by 1 for all indices n for which a; n = 0. By the theorem of limits 44,4, since

lg 7 " 

This proves the theorem. 

Further, it is at once clear that in the statement of this theorem, the 
numbers D n may on both sides be replaced by others D n f asymptotically equal 
to them. 

3. These remarks now enable us to elaborate in the simplest manner the 
considerations indicated at the beginning of (his section: 

00 

a) The series d nt with d n = l, i. e. D n n, must be considered as the 

n=l 

simplest of all divergent series, for the natural numbers D n = n form the proto- 
type of divergence to 4-OO. The theorem of Abel-Dim then shows at once that 
the harmonic series 

converges for 

diverges for a <J 1 , 
and the theorem in 2. shows further that in the latter case we have for a = 1 , 



i-( C01 

=i n a \ di\ 



(cf. 128,2). 

b) Now choosing for 2 d n , in the theorem of Abel-Dini, the series - 

newly recognised to be divergent by a), and replacing, as we may by Land 2., 
D n by > n ' = logw, we conclude that 

converges when a > 1 
diverges when a < 1 . 
The theorem in 2. shows further that

hence in all the series which will occur in the sequel.

whatever value is given to the positive integer p. The partial sums of the series 
for a = 1 satisfy the asymptotic relation

4. A theorem analogous to 173, but starting from a convergent series, 
is the following: 

Theorem of Dfnl. If Sc n is a convergent series of positive terms, and 
r n _ l = c n -j- c n + 1 + - denotes its remainder after the (n l y th term, then 

v _n_ s v Cn converges when or < 1 , 



(c n -{- r n H t -| ---- ) a I diverges when a :> 1 . 

Proof. The divergent case is again quite ea v sily dealt with, since, 
for or = 1 , 

_?*__ 4. ... 



and for eveiy (fixed) n, this value may be made ^> - by a suitable choice 

Z 

of ^, as r^ -0. By 81,2 the series must therefore then diverge. For a> 1 
this will a fortiori also be the case, since r n is <; 1 for every sufficiently 
large n. 

If, however, o: << 1, we may choose a positive integer p so that -< 1 -- , 



and it now suffices again because r n < 1 for n >> w x to establish the con- 
vergence of the series 



-l 



where T = . 



Now r n tends monotonely to and consequently 2 ( f> n-i~" r n) is cer " 
tainly convergent with positive terms. It therefore suffices to show that

that is to say 

(i- y *)Pd-y) 

But the latter relation is evident, since <C y < 1 . 



22 If we wiite e =e', e e ' = e", . . ., c' (r) = c (|i+1) , ... and denote by [fi (v) J = ^ 

the largest integer contained in (<) ( ^ , we may say that the factors in the 
denominators of the terms of our series are all > 1, if n be taken to start 
from the value (^+1).

294 Chapter IX. Series of positive terms. 

40. Series of monotonely diminishing positive terms. 

Our previous investigations concerned for the most part series of 
quite arbitrary positive terms. The comparison series used for the con- 
struction of our criteria, however, were almost always of a much simpler 
nature; in particular, their terms decreased monotonely. It is clear that 
for such scries simpler laws altogether will become valid and perhaps 
also simpler tests of convergence may be constructed. 

We have already shown in 80 that if in a convergent series 2 c n the 
terms dimmish monotonely to zero, we have necessarily n c n ~> 0, a fact 
which need not occur in the case of other convergent series (even with 
positive terms only). Again, Cauchy's condensation test 77 belongs to 
the series we are considering. 

We propose to institute one or two further investigations of this 
kind and, in the first instance, to deduce for such series a few very 
simple and at the same time very far reaching criteria. Their con- 
vergence, as we shall see, is often very much more easily determined 
than that of more general types of series.

176. ! The integral test' 24 . Let 2 a n be a given series of monotonely 

n=l 

diminishing terms. If there exist a function f(x), positive and monotone 
decreasing for x ^> 1 , for which 

f(n) a n for every n, 

then 2a n converges if, and only if, the numbers 



are bounded* 7 *. 

Proof. Since, for (k 1)<^<^A, we have f(f)^a j( , and 
for *<*<* + !, f(t)a k , (A an integer 2* 2), it follows (by 19, 
Theorem 20), that 

fc+l k 

! f(t)dt^a^ f f(t)dt (ft = 2, 3 f ...)

Assuming these inequalities written down for A = 2, 3,..., n and 
added, we obtain

85 By 70, 4 it is of course sufficient that f(n] should be asymptotically 
proportional to the terms a nl or that f(n} = cc n a n with a positive lower limit 
for . Instead of requiring- that / M should remain bounded, we can of 

op 

course also require that J /"(/) di should converge. The two conditions (by 

l 
19, Def. 14) are exactly equivalent. 



40. Series of monotonely diminishing positive terms. 295 

From the right hand inequality it follows, as the integrals J n are 
bounded, that so are the partial sums of the series; from the left 
hand inequality the converse is inferred. This, by 7O, proves all that 
was required. 

Supplement. The differences (s n J n ) at the same time form a monotone 
decreasing sequence with limit between and a r In fact, we have 

fH- 1 



whence the statement follows, since a a ^ s n J n ^> a^ J, I> 0. 
The limit in question is therefore certainly positive, if f(f) is strictly 
monotone decreasing. 

Examples and Illustrations. 

1. This test not only enables us to determine the convergence of numerous 
series, but is also frequently a means of conveniently estimating the rapidity 
of their convergence or divergence. Thus e. g. we can see at once that for 
a > 1 the series 

n 

vi * 



must converge, whereas 

n 

00 -I / j A 

, where / = = log n * + OO, 

n=l n J l

must diverge. But we learn further that, for a > 1 , 

nf k 



( ii< n i < f 
J i < ^ +1 ^ < J 1^' 

n + l n 



and therefore 

T * ~ ~~_i "^ j 



For a = 2, this evaluation was already established on p. 260. In the same way 
the supplement to 176 gives a fresh proof of the fact that the difference 



is the term of a monotone descending sequence tending- to a positive limit 
between and 1. This was Euler's constant mentioned in 128, 2. 

Similarly, the supplement also shows that when < a < 1 , the difference 



i 

is the term of a monotone descending sequence with a positive limit less than 1. 
Therefore, in particular (cf. 44, 6), for <; a -< 1 : 



and it is easily seen that this relation holds equally when a < 0. 



296 Chapter IX. Series of positive terms. 

2. More generally, from 



logpi/( ifa=li 

we can immediately deduce, by the same method, the known conditions ot 
convergence and divergence of Abel's series. We have now three totally 
distinct methods of obtaining these. The supplement to 176 again affords us 
good evaluations of the remainders in the case of convergence, and of the 
partial sums in the case of divergence. 

3. If f(x) be positive for every sufficiently large x, and possesses, for 
those x's, a differential coefficient equal to a monotone decreasing (also posi- 
tive) function with the limit at infinity, the ratio f'(x)lf(x) is also mono- 
tone decreasing. Since 



it follows that the integrals 



f tiw 
j~JW d '~ 



X 

f (/) dt and 

are either both bounded or both unbounded. Hence we conclude that the series 
2f'(n) and J7-C'- 



J 



will either both converge or both diverge. In the case of divergence, when 
necessarily f(n) *-f-OO, we have 



f f (n\

In fact, here

whence the validity of the statement can be directly inferred. These theorems 
are closely connected with the theorem of Abel-Dim. 

2. A test of practically the same scope, and independent of the 
integral calculus in its wording, is 

Ermakoffs test 29 . 

177. If f(x) is related to a given series 2 a n of positive, monotonely 

diminishing terms, in the manner described in the integral test, and 
also satisfies the conditions there laid down, then 



\ diverges l f(x) 

for every sufficiently large x. 

Proof. If we suppose the first of these inequalities satisfied for 
xx 9 we have for these x's

Thus the integral on the left, and hence also J f(f)dt, is, for every

fore converge, by the integral test. 

If, on the other hand, we assume the second inequality satisfied 
for x > afj, we have, for these a;'s, 



A comparison of the first and third integrals shows further that 



On the right hand side of this inequality, we have a fixed quantity 
y > 0, and the inequality expresses the fact that for every w(>ar 1 ) 
we can assign k n so that (with the same meaning for J n as in 176) 



By 46 and 5O, the numbers J n cannot be bounded and 2, a n therefore 
cannot converge * 7 . 

Remarks. 

1. Ennahof/'s test bears a certain resemblance to Cauchy's condensation 
test It contains, in particular, like the latter, the complete logarithmic com- 
parison scale, to which we have thus a fourth mode of approach. In fact, the 
behaviour of the series 



nlogn ..\ 
is determined by that of the ratio 



a? It is not difficult to carry out the proof without introducing 1 integrals, 
but it makes it rather more clumsy. 



298 Chapter IX. Series of positive terras. 

As this ratio tends to zero, when a > 1 , but *-f-OO, when a. < 1 , Ermako/fs 
test therefore provides the known conditions for convergence and divergenc** 
of these series, as asserted 28 . 

2. We may of course make use of other functions instead of e x . If q> (x) 
is any monotone increasing- positive function, everywhere differentiate, for 
which <p (x) >> x always, the series 2a H will converge or diverge according as 
we have

With Ermakoffs test and Cauchy's integral test, we have command over 
the most important tests for our present series. 

41. General remarks on the theory of the convergence 
and divergence of series of positive terms. 

Practically the whole of the 19 th century was required to estab- 
lish the convergence tests set forth in the preceding sections and to 
elucidate their meaning. It was not till the end of that century, and in 
particular by Pringsheini's investigations, that the fundamental questions 
were brought to a satisfactory conclusion. By these researches, 
which covered an extiemely extensive field, a scries of questions were 
also solved, which were only timidly approached before his time, 
although now they appear to us so simple and transparent that it 
seems almost inconceivable that they should have ever presented any 
difficulty 20 , still more so, that they should have been answered m a com- 
pletely erroneous manner. How great a distance had to be traversed 
before this point could be reached is clear if we reflect that Eider 
never troubled himself at all about questions of convergence; when a 
series occurred, he would attribute to it, without any hesitation, the 
value of the expression which gave rise to the series 30 . Lagrange in 
17 70 31 was still of the opinion that a series represents a definite 
value, provided only that its terms decrease to O 32 . To refute the latter 



28 This also holds for = 0, if we interpret log^x to mean e*. 

29 As a curiosity, we may mention that, as late as 1885 and 1889, several 
memoirs were published with the object of demonstrating- the existence of con- 

vergent series J c * for which -"-^" 1 did not tend to a limit! (Cf. 159, 3.)

assumption expressly by referring to the fact (at that time already 
well known) of the divergence of J? , appears to us at present 

superfluous, and many other presumptions and attempts at proof cur- 
rent in previous times are in the same case. Their interest is there- 
fore for the most part historical. A few of the questions raised, how- 
ever, whether answeied in the affirmative or negative, remain of 
sufficient interest for us to give a rapid account of them. A con- 
siderable proportion of these are indeed of a type to which anyone 
who occupies himself much with series is naturally led. 

The source of all the questions which we propose to discuss 
resides in the inadequacy of the ciiteria. Those which are necessary 
and sufficient for convergence (the main criterion 81) are of so general 
a nature, that in particular cases the convergence can only rarely be ascer- 
tained by their means. All our remaining tests (comparison tests or trans- 
formations of comparison tests) were sufficient criteria only, and they only 
enabled us to recognise as convergent series which converge at least 
as rapidly as the comparison series employed. The question at once 
arises : 

1. Does a series exist which converges less rapidly than any other/ 178. 
This question is already answered, in the negative, by the theorem 

175, 4. In fact, when Zc n converges, so docs 2c n ' = -r 2 -* though, 

V 

r n-l 
obviously, less rapidly than 2c n , as c n :c n ' = r_ l > 0. 

The question is answered almost more simply by /. Hadamard 2 *', 
who takes the series ~c n ' = ^(l/r n _ 1 V r n ). Since c n = r n _ 1 r w , 
the ratio c n '' = VV n - 1 + W n * 0. The accented series conver- 
ges less rapidly than the unaccented series. 

The next question is equally easy to solve: 

2. Does a series exist which diverges less rapidly than any other? 
Here again, the theorem of Abel-Dini 173 shows us that when 2d n 

diverges, so does 2d n ' = 2j~> an d hence the answer has to be in 

the negative. In fact as d n : d n ' = D n * -|- oo, the theorem provides, 
for each given divergent series, another whose divergence is not so 
rapid. 

These circumstances, together with our preliminary remarks, 
show that 

3. No comparison test can be effective with all series. 

Closely connected with this, we have the following question, raised* 
and also answered, by Abel**: 



83 Actti mathematica, Vol. 18, p. 319. 1894. 

). f. d. reine u. angew. Math., Vol. 3, p. 80. 1828 



300 Chapter IX. Series of positive terms.

/ r n n \ are su ff t cient conditions for \ T . } 

b) n a w ^ a > J ' 'I divergence J 

o/ Vy;y possible series of positive terms? 

It again follows from the theorem of Abel-Dini that this is not 
the case. In fact, if we put a n = --, a > 0, the series ^0 n necessar- 

r /I 

ily diverges, and hence so does a n '^~ > where s n = a L -}- + # n . 
But, for the latter, p n a n / =~^0. 

The object of the comparison tests was, to some extent, the con- 
struction of the widest possible conditions sufficient for the determination 
of the convergence or divergence of a series. Conversely, it might be 
required to construct the narrowest possible conditions necessary for 
the convergence or divergence of a series. The only information we 
have so far gathered on this subject is that a n > is necessary for 
convergence. It will at once occur to us to ask: 

5. Must the terms a n of a convergent series tend to zero with 
any particular rapidity? It was shown by Pringsheim** that this is 
not the case. However slowly the numbers p n may tend to -{- oo, we 
can invariably construct conveigent series 2 c n for which 

KPn C n= + 00 ' 

Indeed every convergent series -Tc 7 /, by a suitable rearrangement, will 
produce a series 2 c n to support this statement 36 . 

Proof. We assume given the numbers p n , increasing to -|- oo, 
and the convergent scries 2c n '. Let us choose the indices x , n 2 , ..., 
n , . . . odd and such that 



and let us write c n = cj r -i, filling in the remaining c n 's with the terms 
c/, c 4 ' y ... in their original order. The series 2 c n is obviously a re- 
arrangement of c n '. But 

Pn C n>* 

whenever n becomes equal to one of the indices n 9 . Accordingly, as 
asserted, 



The underlying fact in this connection is simply that the behaviour 
or a sequence of the form (p n c n ) bears no essential relation to that of 

to Math. Annalen, Vol. 35, p 344. 1890 

86 Cf. Theorem 82, 3, which takes into account a sort of decrease on 
the average of the terms a n , 



41. General remarks on series of positive terms. 301 

the series 2 c n i. e. with the sequence of partial sums of this 
series, since the latter, though not the former, may be funda- 
mentally altered by a rearrangement of its terms. 

6. Similarly, no condition of the form lim p n d n > is necessary 
for the divergence of 2 d n , however rapidly the positive numbers p n 
may increase to -f-oo 37 . On the contrary, every divergent series 2d n ', 
provided its terms tend to 0, becomes, on being suitably rearranged, 
a series 2 d n (still divergent, of course) for which \imp n d n Q. 
The proof is easily deduced on the same lines as the preceding. 

The following question goes somewhat further: 

7. Does a scale of comparison tests exist which is sufficient for 
all cases? More precisely: Given a number of convergent series 

v r (i) y r (2) y r (*) 

-^ n > ^ C n ' ' > ^ C n > ' ' 

each of which converges less rapidly than the preceding, with e. g. 






() > + ao, for fixed k. 

(The logarithmic scale affords an example of such series.) 7s it pos- 
sible to construct a series converging less rapidly than any of the given 
series? The answer is in the affirmative 38 . The actual construction 
of such a series is indeed not difficult. With a suitable choice of the

in fact for n > n q (q > k) we have obviously ^ > 2* *. This proves 

all that was required. In particular, there are series converging 
more slowly than all the series of our logarithmic scale 39 . 

8. We may show, quite as simply, that, given a number of di- 
vergent series 2d n (k \ & = 1, 2, ..., each diverging less rapidly than 
the preceding, with, specifically, ^ +1) -f-d n (fc) +0, say, there are always 
divergent series 2 d n diverging less rapidly than every one of the 
series 2 d^ '. 

All the above remarks bring us near to the question whether and 
to what extent the terms of convergent series are fundamentally dishn 
guishable from those of divergent series. In consequence of 7. and 8., we 
shall no longer be surprised at the observation of Stieltjesi 

9. Denoting by (e l , e 3 , . . .) an arbitrary monotone descending se- 
quence with limit 0, a convergent series 2c n and a divergent series 
2d n can always be specif ied, such that c n = e n d n . In fact, if e n *0 

monotonely, p n = -- > -f- oo monotonely. The series 

ff 



whose partial sums are the numbers p n , is therefore divergent. By 
the theorem of Abel-Dini, the series

n=l ^ ii + i 
is also divergent But the series 2cz==2s d^~y]\- ) is

The following remark is only a re-statement in other words of 
the above: 

10. However slowly n *+oo, there is a convergent series 2c n 
and a divergent series 2 d n for which ^ n = p n c n . 

In this respect, the two remarks due to Pringsheim, given in 5. 
and 6., may be formulated even more forcibly as follows: 



89 The missing- initial Urms of these series may be assumed to be each 
replaced by unity. 



41. General remarks on series of positive terms. 303 

1J. However rapidly 2c n may converge, there are always divergent 
series, indeed divergent series with monotonely diminishing 
terms of limit 0, for which 



Thus 2 d n must have an infinite number of terms essentially smaller 
than the corresponding terms of 2 c n . Conversely: 

However rapidly 2 d n may diverge, provided only d n *0, there 
are always convergent series 2c n for which lim^ = +00. 

We have only to prove the former statement. Here a scries 2 d n 
of the form 

V d =- -1- -4- 4- I- - -\~ - -4- 4- - 
,1 ,1 , ,1 ,1 



is of the required kind, if the increasing sequence of indices n I9 w 3 , ... 
be chosen suitably and the successive groups of equal terms contain 
respectively n 19 (n. n 1 ), (n 3 ~ w a ), ... terms. In fact, in order that 
this scries may diverge, it is sufficient to choose the number of terms in 
each group so large that their sum > 1, and in order that the se- 
quence of terms in the series be monotone, it is sufficient to choose 
n k > n k ^ l so large that r nfc < c n/ , _ j (ft = 1, 2, . . . ; n = 1) as is always 

possible, since c n *0. As the ratio has the value - for n = n k , 

it follows that km = 0, as required. 

n 

In the preceding remarks we have considered only convergence 
or divergence per se. It might be hoped that wiih narrower require- 
ments, e. g. that the terms of the series should diminish monotonely, 
a correspondingly greater amount of information could be obtained. 
Thus, as we have seen, for a convergent series 2c n whose terms 
diminish monotonely, we hiwe nc n *0. Can more than this be asserted? 
The answer is in the negative (cf. Rem. 5): 

12. However slowly the positive numbers p n may increase to + oo, 
there are always convergent series of monotonely diminishing terms 
for which 

n Pn c n 
not only does not tend to 0, but has +00 for upper limit 40 . 

40 Pnngsheim, loc. cit. In particular it was much discussed whether for 
convergent series of positive terms* diminishing- monotonrly, the expression 
nlogn>c n must -*(); the opinion was held by many, as late as I860, that 
n log n*c n * was necessary for convergence. 



304 Chapter IX. Series of positive terms. 

The proof is again quite easy. Choose indices n < n. 2 < 
such that 

P*,>** (*=1,2,.

The groups of terms here indicated contribute successively less than

2 2* 2" 

converge. On the other hand, for each n = w, we have 



so that, as was required, 

limn-p n .c n = +00. 

13. These remarks may easily be multiplied and extended in all 
possible directions. They make it clear that it is quite useless to 
attempt to introduce anything of the nature of a boundary between 
convergent and divergent series, as was suggested by P. du Bois- 
Reymond. The notion involved is of course vague at the outset. But 
in whatever manner we may choose to render it precise, it will never 
correspond to the actual circumstances. We may illustrate this on the 
following lines, which obviously suggest themselves 41 . 

a) As long as the terms of the series -S"c n and 2 d n aie subjected 
to no restriction (excepting that of being > 0), the ratio ~ is capable 
of assuming all possible values, as besides the inevitable relation 

lim -^ = we may also have lim-^ = +00.

The polygonal graphs by which the two sequences (c n ) and (d n ) may be 
represented, in accordance with 7, 6, can therefore intersect at an in- 
definite number of points (which may grow more and more numerous, 
to an arbitrary extent). 

41 A detailed and careful discussion of all the questions belonging to the sub- 
ject will be found in Pringsheim*s work mentioned on p. 2, and also in his writings 
in the Math. Ann. Vol. 35 and in the Munch. Ber. Vol. 26 (1890) and 27 (181)7), 
to which we have repeatedly referred. 



42. Systematization of the general theory of convergence. 305 

b) By our remark 11, this remains true when the two sequences 
(c n ) and (d n ) are both monotone, in which case the graphs above referred 
to are both monotone descending polygonal lines. It is therefore certainly 
not possible to draw a line stretching to the right, with the property that 
every sequence of type (c n ) has a graph, no part of which lies above the line 
in question, and every sequence of type (d n ) a graph, no part of which lies 
below this line, even if the two graphs are monotone and are considered 
only from some point situated at a sufficiently great distance to the right. 

14. Notes 11 and 12 suggest the question whether the statements 
there made remain unaltered if the terms of the constructed scries 2 c n 
and 27 d n are not merely simply monotone as above, but fully monotone 
in the sense of p. 263. This question has been answered in the affirmative 
by H. Hahn^. 



42. Systematization of the general theory of convergence. 

The element of chance inherent in the theory of convergence as 
developed so far gave rise to various attempts to systematize the criteria 
from more general points of view. The first extensive attempts of this 
kind were made by P. du Bois-Reymond 43 , but were by no means brought 
to a conclusion by him. A. Pringsheim** has been the first to accomplish 
this, in a manner satisfactory both from a theoretical and a practical stand- 
point. We propose to give a short account of the leading features of the 
developments due to him 45 . 

All the criteria set forth in these chapters have been comparison tests, 
and their common source is to be found in the two comparison tests of 
the first and second kinds, 157 and 158. The former, namely 

(I) =<? s e > a n ^d n : V, 

is undoubtedly the simplest and most natural test imaginable; not so 
that of the second kind, given originally in the form 



42 //. Hahn, Dber Reihcn mit monoton abnehmenden Ghedern, Monatsheft 
f. Math. u. Physik, Vol. 33, pp. 121134, 1923.

44 Math. Ann. Vol. 35, pp. 297394. 1890. 

45 We have all the more reason for dispensing with details in this connexion, 
seeing Pringsheim's researches have been developed by the author himself in a 
very complete, detailed, and readily accessible form. 



306 Chapter IX. Series of positive terms. 

In considering the ratio of two successive terms of a series we are 
already going beyond what is directly provided by the series itself. 
We might therefore in the first instance endeavour to construct further 
types of tests by means of other combinations of two or more terms 
of the series. This procedure has, however, not yielded any criterion 
of interest in the study of general types of series. 

If we restrict our consideration to the ratio of two terms, it is 
still possible to assign a number of other forms to the criterion of the 
second kind; e. g. the inequalities may be multiplied by the positive 
factors a n or c n without altering their significance. We shall return to 
this point later. Except for these relatively unimportant transformations, 
however, we must regard (I) and (II) as the fundamental forms of all 
criteria of convergence and divergence 46 . All conceivable special com- 
parison tests will be obtained by introducing in (1) and (II) all conceiv- 
able convergent and divergent series, and, if necessary, carrying ovit 
transformations of the kind just indicated. 

The task of systematizing the general theory of convergence will 
accordingly involve above all that of providing a general survey of all 
conceivable convergent and divergent series. 

This problem of course cannot be solved in a literal sense, since 
the behaviour of every series would be determined thereby. We can 
only endeavour to reduce it to factors in themselves easier to survey 
and therefore not appearing so urgently to require further treatment. 
Pringsheim shows and this is essentially the starting point of his 
investigations that a systematization of the general theory of convergence 
can be fully carried out when we assume as given the totality of all 
monotone sequences of (positive] numbers increasing to +00. 

Such a sequence will be denoted by (pj; thus 

< Po ^ Pi ^ P2 ^ and Pn -* + 

In principle, the problem is solved by the two following simple 
remarks: 

a) Every divergent series 2 d n is expressible in the form 

2d n *zpo + (Pi JP ) H h (Pn Pn-l) H 

n=0 

(each in one and only one way) in terms of a suitable sequence of 
type (p n ). Also, every series of this form is divergent. 



46 Thus since (as seen in 16O, 1,2) (II) is a consequence of (I) - it 
is ultimately from (1) that all the rest follows. 



42 Systematization of the general tneory of convergence. 307 
b) Every convergent series 47 2c n is expressible in the form 
/ * Mi/ 1 ! \i ./ * \ , 

V / c= I - - 1 + 1 - - I + + I - - I + * 

H ^ C ~\P Q Pj ^ \P { P,)^ ^\P n Pn+l)^ 

(each in one and only one way) in terms of a suitable sequence of 
type ( w ). Also, every series of this form is convergent. 

In fact, when these statements have been established, we have 
only to substitute, in the two comparison tests (I) and (II), 



respectively for c n and d n > to obtain in principle all conceivable tests 
of the first and second kinds: All particular criteria must necessarily 
follow by more or less obvious transformation from the tests so ob- 
tained; for this very reason, the former can never present anything 
fundamentally new. They become of considerable importance, how- 
ever, m that they give deeper insight into the connexion between the 
various criteria and state the latter in a coherent form, and also apply 
them in practice. Herein lies the chief value of the whole method. It 
would accordingly be well worth our while to describe the details of 
the construction of special criteria exactly; but for the reasons given, 
we shall abide by our plan of giving only a brief account. 

1. The typical forms a) and b) must be regarded as undoubtedly 180. 
the simplest imaginable forms for convergent and divergent series. 
But we can obviously replace them by many other forms, thereby 
altering the outward form of the criteria in various ways. For instance, 
by the theorem of Abel-Dini 173, 



diverge with 2(p n /> n -i)> while at the same time, by Pringsheim's 
theorem 174, 

2~ n -~^- and 2 -",, 

converge for Q > 0. With a few restrictions of little importance, all 
divergent and convergent series are also expressible in one of these 
new forms. 

2. Since the only condition to be satisfied by the numbers p 9 
in the typical forms of divergent and convergent series which we are 



7 Unless the terms are all from some stage on. 

48 The pi oofs of these two statements are so easy that we need not go into 
them further. 



308 Chapter IX. Series of positive terms. 

considering, is that they are to increase monotonely to f- oo, we may of 
course write \ogp n , iog 2 /> n , ... or generally F (p n ) instead of /> n , where 
F (x) denotes any function defined for x > and increasing monotonely 
(in the strict sense) to +0 with x. This again leads to criteria which, 
though not essentially new, are formally so when the /> w 's arc specially 
chosen. It is easy to verify that the first named types of series diverge 
or converge more and more slowly, as />-> + oo more and more slowly; 
by replacing p n successively e. g. by logp n , Iog 2 /> n , . . . , we therefore 
obtain a means of constructing scales of criteria 4a . The case p n = n 
naturally calls for consideration on account of its peculiar simplicity; the 
development of the ideas indicated above for this particular case forms 
the main contents of 37 and 38. 

3. A further advantage of this method is due to the fact that one and 
the same sequence (p n ) will serve to represent both a divergent and a con- 
vergent series. The criteria therefore naturally occur in pairs. E. g. every 
comparison test of the first kind may be deduced from the pair of tests: 



<; 

~ 



'Pn 



PnPn-l 

* 
n Pn-l 



. = A.-I 

and similarly for other typical forms of series. 

4. The right hand sides can be combined to form a single disjunctive 
criterion, if we introduce a modification, arbitrary in character in so far as 
it is not necessarily suggested by the general trend of ideas, but otherwise 
of a simple nature. We see at once, for instance, that the series 



_ 

Pn 

n 

converge when a > 1 and diverge when a ^ ] . For the first of these scries 
the proof has just been given; and the second has all its terms less than 
the first if a > 1, while if a = 1, and hence for all a 2> 1, it is immediately 
seen to be divergent. The pair of criteria set up in 3. may accordingly 
be replaced by the following disjunctive criterion: 



49 The usual passage from p n direct to log p n , Iog 2 p n , . . . , is again quite an 
arbitrary step, of course. Theorems 77 and 175, 2 render the step natural, however. 
Between e. g. p n and log/> n , we could easily introduce intermediary stages, for 
instance e**^ w hich increases less rapidly than /> n> in fact less rapidly than 
any fixed positive power of p n , however small its exponent, yet more rapidly 
than every fixed positive power of log p n , however large its exponent.

It is remarkable that in the criteria of convergence arising through 
these transformations, the assumption p n + + oo is no longer necessary 
at all. It is sufficient that (p n ) should be monotone. In fact, it (p n ) is boun- 

ded, the convergence of 2(p n p n -j), and hence that of J * - - and 



-**-*- for arbitrary a > 0, follows from that of (p n ), as (p~ a ) 

GC H 

and (cc~ p ) are also bounded sequences. These convergence tests 51 thus 
possess a special degree of generality, similar to that of Kummers^ cri- 
terion of the second kind, mentioned below in 7. 

5. From this disjunctive criterion as indeed in general from any 
criterion others may again be deduced by various transformations, 
though the criteria so obtained can be new only in form. For these 
transformations we can of course lay down no general rule; new ways 
may always be found by skill and intuition. This is the reason for 
the great number of criteria which ultimately remain outside the scope 
of any given systematization. 

It is obvious that every inequality may be multiplied by arbitrary 
positive factors without altering its meaning; similarly we may form 
the same function F(x) of either member, provided F(x) be monotone 
increasing (in the stricter sense), in particular we may take log- 
arithms, roots, etc. of cither side. E. g. the last disjunctive criterion 
may therefore be put into the form 



or

We see at a glance that by this means we obtain a general frame- 
work for the criteria of the preceding sections which were set up by 
assuming p n === n or == log n. 

50 The equivalence is not complete, i. e. with the same sequence (p n ) as basis, 
the new criterion is not so effective as the old one; in fact, the divergence of

terion of the second kind (II), or perform any of the other typical 
substitutions for c n and d n there. In this way we obtain the most general 
form of the criteria of the second kind. 

1. We may observe (cf. Rem. 4.) that here again, after carrying 
out a simple transformation, we may so frame the convergence test 
that it combines with the divergence test to form a single disjunctive 
criterion. The convergence test requires in the first instance that, for 
every sufficiently large n, 



or

as p n cancels out, the typical terms of a divergent series automatically 
appear, so that the convergence test reduces to

Finally, if we take into account the fact that 2 Q d n (Q > 0) diverges 
with 2d n , the criterion takes the form: 



n , 



Now the original criterion is certainly satisfied by the assumption

It thus appears that in this form slightly less general than the 
original form of the convergence test, it is absolutely indifferent 
whether a convergent series or a divergent series is introduced as comparison 
series. Hence, still more generally, the c n 's and d n 's in the above forms 
of the criterion may be replaced by any (positive) numbers b n ; thus 
we may write:

All further details will be found in the papers and treatise by 
A. Pringsheim. The sequences of ideas sketched above can of course 
lead only to criteria having the nature of comparison tests of the first 
or second kinds, though all criteria of this character may be developed 
thereby. The integral test 176 and Ermakoff's test 177 of course 
could not occur in the considerations of this section, as they do not 
possess the character in question.

43. Tests of convergence for series of arbitrary terms. 

With series of positive terms, the study of convergence and 
divergence was capable of systematization to some extent; in the 
case of series of arbitrary terms, all attempts of this kind have 
to be abandoned. The reason lies not so much in insufficient de-

velopment of the theory, as in the essence of the matter itself. 
A series of arbitrary terms may- converge, without converging abso- 
lutely 1 . Indeed this is practically the only case which will interest us 
here, as the question of absolute convergence reduces, by 85, to the 
study of a series of positive terms. We therefore need only consider 
the case in which either the series is actually not absolutely conver- 
gent or its absolute convergence cannot be demonstrated by any of 
the previously acquired means. If a series is conditionally conver- 
gent, however, this convergence is dependent on the mode of succession 
of the terms as well as on their individual values; any comparison test 
which we might set up would therefoie have to concern the series 
as a whole, and not merely its terms individually, as before. This 
ultimately means that each series has to be examined by itself and 
we cannot obtain a general method of approach valid for them all. 
Accordingly we have to be content to establish criteria with a 
more restricted field of validity. The chief instrument for the purpose 
is the formula known as 

Abel's partial summation 9 . // a Q ,a 19 ... and b Q , b^, ... denote 182. 
arbitrary numbers, and we write 

<*0 + <*1 H ----- h = A n (" k 0)

by summation from v = n -\- 1 to v n -f- k, the statement at once 
follows 3 . 

Supplements. 1. The formula continues to hold when n=^ 1,183, 
if we put A_i = 0. 



1 The case in which the series may be transformed into one with posi- 
tive terms only, by means of a "finite number of alterations" (v. 82,4) or by 
a change of sign of all its terms, of course requires no special treatment.

Abel's partial summation enables us to deduce a number of tests of 
convergence for series of the form 2 a v b v almost immediately 4 . In the

where Sa v b v s, 2 A v (b v b v+1 ) = s', lim A 9 b M = /. 

In particular, 5 = 5' if, and only if, / = 0. 

The theorem does not solve the question as to the convergence of the 
series E a v b v , since it merely reduces it to two new questions; but these 
are in many cases simpler to treat. The result is in any case a far-reaching 
one, and it enables us immediately to deduce the following more special 
criteria, which are comparatively easy to apply. 

1. Abel's test 6 . Za v b v is convergent if 2 a v converges and (b n ) 
is monotone 6 and bounded 7 . 



4 We can of course reduce any series to this form, as any number can be 
expressed as the product of two other numbers. Success in applying the above 
theorem will depend on the skill with which the terms are so split up. 

6 loc. cit. Abel's test provides a sufficient condition to be satisfied by (6 n ), 
in order that the convergence of 2 a n may involve that of Z a n b n . J. Hadamard 
(Acta math., Vol. 27, p. 177. 1903) gives necessary and sufficient conditions; cf. 
E. B. Elliot (Quarterly Journ., Vol. 37, p. 222. 190(5), who gives various refinements. 

6 In anticipation of the extension to complex numbers (v. p. 397) it may be em- 
phasized already that a sequence of numbers assumed to be monotone is necessarily 
real. 

7 In other words: A convergent series "may" be multiplied, term by term, by 
factors forming a bounded and monotone sequence. Theorem 184 and the criteria 
deduced from it all deal with the question: By what factors may the terms of a 
convergent series be multplied so that a convergent series results? And by what 
factors must the terms of a divergent series be multiplied, so that the resulting series 
may be convergent? 



43. Tests of convergence for series of arbitrary terms. 315 

Proof. By hypothesis (A n ) and (b n ), (v. 46), and hence also (A n n+1 ), 
are convergent. On the other hand, by 131, the series (b v b v+1 ) is 
convergent, and indeed absolutely convergent, as its terms all have the 
same sign, in consequence of the monotony of (b n ). It follows, by 87, 
2, that the series E A v (b lt b^ +l ) is also convergent, since a convergent 
sequence is certainly bounded. The two conditions of theorem 184 are 
accordingly fulfilled and S a v b v is convergent. 

2. Dirichlet's test 8 . Za v b v is convergent if 2 a v has bounded 
partial sums and (b n ) is a monotone null sequence. 

Proof. By the same reasoning as above, 2 A v (& b v+l ) is con- 
vergent. Further, as (A n ) is bounded, (A n b n+l ) is a null sequence if (b n ) 
is, i. e. it is certainly convergent. The two conditions of 184 are again 
fulfilled. 

3. Tests of du Bois-Reymond* and Dedekind 

a) 2 a v b v is convergent if 2 (b v ^.+i) converges absolutely and a v 
converges, at least conditionally. 

Proof. By 87, 2, Z 1 A v - (b v b v+l ) also converges, as (A n ) is cer- 
tainly bounded. Since further 

(*o - *i) + (*i ~ *2) + - - + (ft-i - 6) = *o - b n 

tends to a limit when n -> + GO, so does b n itself; lim A n exists by hypo- 
thesis, and the existence of lim A n b n+1 follows. 

b) 2 a v b v is convergent if Z (b v 6, +1 ) converges absolutely and E a v 
has bounded partial sums, provided b n -> 0. 

Proof. 2 A v (b v b y+1 ) is again convergent and A n b n+l -> 0.

series with alternately positive and negative terms (82,5).

converges, if (& n ) denotes any null sequence. 

4. If 2 a n is convergent, the power series 2 a n x n is convergent for 
0<jo;<-f-l, since the factors x n form a monotone and bounded sequence. 
If E a n merely has bounded partial sums, the power series at any rate con- 
verges for every x such that 0<o;<Cl, since x n then tends to monotoncly. 

5. The series ^sinna; and J cos.no; have bounded partial sums, the first 
for every (fixed) real x and the second for every (fixed) real x not a multiple 
of 2ji. This follows from the following elementary but important formula, 
valid ll for every x 4= 2 k iri 

x / x\ 

sin n sin f a. + (n -f- 1) ~J 

sin (a + x) -f sin (a -f 2 x) -f- --- H sin (a -f n x) = -- . 

sin | 

The proof of the formula is given in 201. For a = 0, we get 

sin n - sin (n -f- 1) 
sin x -f sin 2 a; -f- -f- sin n x = --- , (x =j= 2 fc rc)

and for a = - , 

a; a;

cos a; + cos 2 cc + -f cos w a; = - , (x -]- 2 A n) . 

sin | 

From this the boundedness of the partial sums can be inferred at once. 

Thus if 2(b n & n +i) converges absolutely and & /t ->0, we conclude from 
the criterion 3b that 

^T b n sin n x converges for every x , 

2b n cos n x converges for every x =f- 2 & ^r . 

In particular 12 , this is the case when b n diminishes monotonely to 0. 

6. If the b n 's are positive, and if we may write 



where 3 > o and (/? n ) is bounded, then 2"(-- l) n b n converges if, and only t/ f a > 0. In 
fact, if a > 0, it follows from these hypotheses that --!<; 1 from some stage on, 

i. e. (6 n ) decreases monotonely, and the convergence of the series in question is 
therefore secured by 2., if we can show that 6 n ->0. The proof of this is 
similar to that of the parallel fact in 17O, 1 : Jf < a' < a, we have for every 
sufficiently large v t say v>w, 



11 For x=2k7t, the sum has obviously the value n sin a, for all n's.

43. Tests of convergence for series of arbitrary terms. 317 

Writing down this inequality for v = m, m-f-1, ..., n 1 and multiplying 
together, we obtain 



From the divergence of the harmonic series, it follows as in 170, 1 that 6 n ->0. 
In the case a < 0, b n must for similar reasons increase monotonely from 
some stage on, so that 2 ( l) n b n certainly cannot converge. Finally, when 
a = 0, we deduce in precisely the same way as on p. 289, that b n cannot tend to 
and the series therefore cannot converge.

series; we shall investigate them in more detail later on ( 58, A) is con- 
vergent for a particular value of x, say x = x , it also converges for every 

x>x 09 for f ) is a monotone null sequence. This simple application of 

\n x ~ x J 
Abel's test, by reasoning quite similar to that employed for power series (93), 

leads to the theorem: Every series of the form ^ ~ possesses a definite abscissa 

of convergence JL with the property that the series converges whenever x > Jl and 
diverges whenever x<Ji. (For further details, v. 58, A.) 

General Remarks. 186. 

1. We have already mentioned the fact that the magnitude of the indiv- 
idual term in an arbitrary scries is not conclusive with regard to convergence. 
In particular, two series 2 a n and Zb n , whose terms are asymptotically equal, 

i. e. such that * - 1 , need not exhibit the same behaviour as regards con- 
vergence (cf. 7O, 4). 
Thus e. g. for 



we have 

b n ~~ log n ~* 

But Sb n is convergent and S a n divergent, since 2(a n b n ) diverges by 79,2. 
2. // the series ~ a n is non-absolutely convergent^ (cf. p. 136, footnote 9), its 
positive and it* negative terms, taken separately, form two divergent series. More 
precisely, let p n a n when a n > 0, and = when a n < 0, and similarly let q n = a n 
when a n < 0, and =0 when a w ^>0. 18 The two series 2p n and 2 q n are scries 
of positive terms, the first containing only the positive terms of 2 a n and the 
second only the absolute values of the negative terms of 2a nj in either case 
with the places unchanged, while their other terms are all 0. Both these series 
are divergent. In fact, as every partial sum of 2 a n is the difference of two 
suitable partial sums of 2p H and 2 q n , it follows at once that if 2 p n and 2 q n 
were both convergent, so would 2"|a w | be (by 70), contrary to hypothesis; 
and if the one were convergent, the other divergent, the partial sums of 2 a n 



Thus i> - ' *" '

would tend to - oo or -f oo (according as 2 p n 01 2 4n is assumed convergent), 
which is again contrary to hypothesis. 

3. By the preceding remark, a conditionally convergent series, or rather 
the sequence formed by its partial sums, is exhibited as the difference of two 
monotone increasing sequences of numbers tending to infinity 14 . As regards 
the rapidity with which these increase, we may easily establish the following 

Theorem. The partial sums of 2 p n and 2 q n are asymptotically equal. 
In fact, we have 



since the numerator in the latter ratio remains bounded, while the denominator 
increases to -J-CX) with n t this ratio tends to 0, which proves the result. 

4. The relative frequency of positive and negative terms in a conditionally 
convergent series 2 a n for which \a n \ diminishes monotonely is subject to the 
following elegant theorem, due to E. Cesaro: The limit, if it exists, of the 

p 
ratio - n of P M the number o/ positive terms } to Q M the number of negative terms a vt 

Qn 
for v<w, is necessarily 1 



44. Rearrangement of conditionally convergent series. 

The fundamental distinction between absolutely and non-absolutely 
convergent series has already been made clear in 89, 2. This is, that 
the behaviour of non-absolutely convergent series depends essentially 
on the order of the terms in the series, so that for these series the 
commutative law of addition no longer holds. The proof consisted in 
showing that a non-absolutely convergent series could, by a mere re- 
arrangement in the order of its terms, be transformed into a divergent 
series. This result may now be considerably elaborated. In fact it 
may be shewn that by a suitable rearrangement any prescribed behav- 
iour, as regards convergence or divergence, may be induced. The 
theorem which we obtain is 

187. Riemann's rearrangement theorem. // 2 a n is a conditionally 

convergent series, we may, by a suitable rearrangement (v. 27, 3), de- 
duce a series 2a^ with any one of the following properties: 



14 It is best to avoid, as being far too superficial in character, the mode 
of expression which may be found in some writings: "the sum of a condition- 
ally convergent series is given in the form CO CO."

a) to converge to an arbitrary 16 prescribed sum s' ; 

b) to diverge to -f- oo or to oo ; 

c) to exhibit as upper and lower limits of its partial sums two 
arbitrary numbers p and x, with ju^>x. 

Proof. It suffices to prove c), since a) and b) are particular cases 
of c), the former for = p, = s' and the latter for x = p, = -f- oo or 
= oo. 

To prove c), let (x n ) be any sequence tending to x and (/* n ) any 
sequence tending to p, y with jji n > x n and 17 ^ > 0. 

Let us denote by p^ 3 , . . . the terms in 2 a n E= a 1 ^- # 2 H ---- 
which are ^ 0, in the order in which they occur, and by q^ 9 q^, . . . 
the absolute values of those which are < 0, again in their proper 
order, thus slightly modifying the definition in 186, 2. The series 
2p and 2 q n only differ from those in 186, 2 by the absence of a 
number of zero terms, and are accordingly both divergent, with posi- 
tive terms which tend to 0. We proceed to show that a series of 
the type 

Pl + P* ---- h Pm l ?i ft ----- ?*, + Pm^l H ----- h 

fe+i ----- fc + #+i H ---- 



will satisfy all the requirements. Such a series is clearly a re- 
arrangement of the given series, and is indeed one which leaves un- 
altered the order of the positive terms relatively to one another and 
that of the negative terms relatively to one another. 

Let us choose the indices m^ < m 3 -. ..., k < k 2 <C . . ., in the 
above series, so that: 

1) the partial sum whose last term is p mi has a value > // x , 
while that ending one term earlier is ^ /^ ; 

2) the partial sum whose last term is q^ has a value < ^, 
while that ending one term earlier is ^> x x ; 

3) the partial sum whose last term is p m ^ has a value > yu , 
while that ending one term earlier is <^ /v 2 ; 



16 Riemann.B.: Abb. d. Ges. d. Wiss. z. Gottingcn, Vol. 13, p. 97. 186668. 
The statements b) and c) are obvious supplementary propositions. 

17 This is clearly possible in any number of ways. In fact, if * = /* with 

a finite value s', say, take * = sf and ft n = s'H , taking ^. even larger, 

n n 

if necessary. If x = ^ = -f OO ( oo), take * w = n ( n) and // n = x w + 2. If, 
finally, *<ft, take any (x n ) and (fi w ) tending to and p\ from some stage 
on, # n <C^Mn, and by a finite number of alterations, we can arrange that this 
may be the case from the beginning, and also that ^^O. 



320 Chapter X. Series of arbitrary terms. 

4) the partial sum whose last term is q kl has a value < x 2 , while 
that ending one term earlier is ^ x 2 ; 

and so on. 

This can always be arranged; for by taking a sufficient number of 
positive terms, the partial sum may be made as large as we please, and 
by allowing a sufficient number of negative ones to follow, the partial 
sum may again be depressed below any assigned value. On the other 
hand, at least one term must be taken at each stage, since x n < /z n ; so 
every term of the original series really does occur in the new series. 

Let H a n ' denote the definite rearrangement of E a n so obtained; 
the partial sums of S a n ' have the prescribed upper and lower limits. In 
fact, if for brevity we denote by r lf r 2 , . . . , the partial sums whose last 
terms are /> Wl , /> m2 , . . . and by cr l9 o- 2 , . . . , those whose last terms arc 
fe fc, , we have 



Since p n -> and q n -> 0, it follows that a, -> x and r v -> /z, so 
that x and /* certainly represent values of accumulation of the partial 
sums of 27 a n . Now a partial sum s n f of 2 a n \ which is neither a a v nor 
a T,,, has necessarily a value between those of two successive partial sums 
of this special type; hence s n ' can have no value of accumulation outside 
the interval x . . . /i, (or different from the common value of x and IJL if 
these coincide). In other words, /x and x are themselves the upper and 
the lower limit of the partial sums, q. e. d. 

Various researches of an analogous nature were started in different directions 
as a consequence of this theorem. M. Ohm 18 and O. Schlomilch 19 investigated 

the effect of rearrangement on the special series 1 ^ + - -+ ..., in par- 

ticular the case in which p positive terms are followed by q negative terms throughout 
(cf. Exercise 148). A. Pringsheim 20 was the first, however, to aim at general results 
for the case in which the relative frequency of the positive and negative terms in 
a conditionally convergent series is modified according to definite prescribed rules. 
E. Borel 21 investigated the opposite problem, as to what rearrangements in a con- 
ditionally convergent series do not alter its sum. Later, W. Sierpinski 22 showed 
that if 27 a n = s converges conditionally and s' < s t the series can be made to have 
the sum s' by rearranging only the positive terms in the series, leaving all the negative 
terms with unaltered place and order > while similarly it can be made to have any 
sum s" > s by rearranging only the negative terms. (The proof is not so simple.) 

45. Multiplication of conditionally convergent series. 

We showed in the preceding section, thus completing the con- 
siderations of 89, 2, that the commutative law of addition no longer 
holds for series which converge only conditionally. We have also seen

45. Multiplication of conditionally convergent series. 321 

already (end of 17), in an example due to Cauchy, that the dis- 
tributive law does not in general subsist, so that the product of two 
such series 2 a n and 2b n may no longer be formed according to the 
elementary rules. The question remained unsolved, however, whether 

the product series Sc n (with c n = a b n + a^ 6 W _ 1 -j (- a n 6 ) might 

not continue to converge under less stringent conditions for 2 a n = A 
and 2b n = B, and to have the sum A-B. In 17, it was required 
that both Za n and 2'6 M should converge absolutely. 

In this connection, we have first the 

Theorem oiMertens 23 . If at least one of the two convergent series 188. 
Z a n = A and 2 b n = B converges absolutely, E c n converges and = A B. 

Proof. We have only to show that, with increasing n, the partial 
sums 

C n = <0 + c l -!-...+* 

= *o h o + K *i + <*i b o) + - + ( a o b n + <*i b n -i + + a n b ) 
tend to A B as limit. We may assume that Z a n is, of the two series, the 
one that converges absolutely. If we denote by A n the partial sums of 
27 # n , by B n those of H b nj we have 

C n = <*o-B n + <* 1 B n _ 1 + + B , 
or, if we put B n = B -\- fl n , 

= *n B + ( /?+ 1 /.-!+-+ A)' 

Since ^4 n -B >-yl -5, it only remains to show lhat when 2a n is 
absolutely convergent and /? n *(), the expressions 

w = .^o + .-iA+- + o/ 

form a null sequence. But this is an immediate consequence of 44, 9 b; 
we have only to put x n = f) n and y n = a n there. Thus the theorem 
is proved. 

Finally, we shall answer the question whether the product series 
2c n , if convergent, necessarily has the sum A-B. 

The answer is in the affirmative, as the following theorem shows: 

Theorem of Abel**. If the three series 2a n , 2b n and 189. 
2c n = 2(a b n -}-- + n & ) are convergent, and A, B, and C are 
their sums, we have A-B C. 

1. Proof. The theorem follows immediately from Abel's limit 
theorem (10O) and was first proved by Abel in this way. If we 
write 
S* * n = /"x (*)> 2b n x = /; (x), 2c n x n = f s (*),

322 Chapter X. Series of arbitrary terms. 

these three power series (cf. 185, 4) certainly converge absolutely for 
<^ a; < 1, and for these values of x, the relation 

(a) A (*)/;(*) = /;(*) 

holds. The assumed convergence of 2a n , 2b n and 2c n implies, by 
Abel's limit theorem 100, that each of the three functions tends to a 
limit when a? * + 1 from the left; and 

fi(x)-+A=2a n , f,(x)-+B = Sb n , f^(x)-+C = 2c n . 

Since the relation (a) holds for all the values of x concerned, it follows 
(by 19, Theorem l) that it must hold in the limit: 



We may also dispense with the use of functions and adopt the 
following 

2. Proof due to Cesdro**. It was shown above that 



From this it follows that 



Dividing both sides of this equality by n -f- 1 and letting n + -f- oo, 
we obtain C as limit on the left hand side (by 43,2) and A-B as 
limit on the right (by 44, 9 a). Hence A-B = C, q. e. d. 

In consequence of this interesting theorem, with which we shall 
again be concerned later on, any further elaboration of the question 
of multiplication of series has only to deal with the problem whether 
the series 2 c n converges. Into these investigations we do not, however, 
propose to enter 36 .

of a related group of much more fundamental theorems.

n=o 

Proof. Since -S 1 ^ 9 converges, a->0; accordingly the series 1 con- 
verges by Leibniz's test. As a n a n + p < a w s for every ^ ^ 1, and ^"a n a converges, 
the series 2 are also convergent for >1. Further, as a n + p + l -< a n + p9 we 
have d p + i<_d p . The series 3 will accordingly converge if cJ^-^O. Now 



given e ^> 0, we can choose m so that aji . 1 -j- aj* , a -J- - - ^-pr-: for every suffi-

and let S n denote the sum of the products ^ a l a ft for which A and fi are <j n.

Chapter XI. 

Series of variable terms (Sequences of functions). 

46. Uniform convergence. 

Thus far, we have almost exclusively taken into consideration 
series whose terms were given (constant) numbers. It was only in 
particularly simple cases that the value of the terms depended on the 
choice of a definite quantity, or variable. Such was the case e. g. when 
we were considering the geometric series 2 a n or the harmonic series 

y 1 ; their behaviour was dependent on the choice of a or of a. A more 
n a 

general example is that of the power series 2 a n x n , where the number 
x had to be given, before we could attack the problem of its con- 
vergence or divergence. This type of case will now be generalized in 
the following obvious way: we shall consider series whose terms depend 
in any manner on a variable x, i. e. are functions of this variable. 
We accordingly denote these terms by f n (x) and consider series of 
the form 2f n (x). 

A function of x, in the general case, is defined only for certain 
values of x (v. 19, Def. 1); for our purposes, it will be sufficient to 
assume that the functions f n (x) are defined in one or more (open or 
closed) intervals For the given series to have a meaning for any value 



46. Uniform convergence. 327 

of x at all, we have to require that at least one point x belongs to 
the intervals of definition of all the functions f n (x). We shall, however, 
at once lay down the condition that there exists at least one interval, 
in which all the functions f n (x) are simultaneously defined. For every 
particular x in this interval, the terms of the series 2f n (x) arc in 
any case all determinate numbers, and the question of its convergence 
can be raised. We shall now assume further that an interval / 
(possibly smaller than the former) exists, for every point of which the 
series f n (x) is found to converge. 



Definition 1 . An interval J will be called an interval of conver- 190. 

of the series 2f n (x) if, at every one of its points (including one, 
both, or neither of its endpoints), all the functions f n (x) are defined 
and the series converges. 

Examples and Illustrations. 

1. For the geometric series 2 x n , the interval 1 < a; <C + 1 is an interval 
of convergence, and no larger interval of convergence exists outside it. 

2. A power series ~ a n (x x ) n , provided it converges at one point at 
least, other than x 09 always possesses an interval of convergence of the form 
(x r) . . . (Xfi-i-r), inclusive or exclusive of one or both endpoints. When r is 
properly chosen, no further interval of convergence exists outside that one. 

1 

8. The harmonic series 2j has as interval of convergence the semi- 

n* 
axis x > 1 , with no further interval of convergence outside it. 



4. As a series is no more than a symbolic expression for a certain se- 
quence of numbers, so the series 2f n (x) represents no more than a different 
symbolic form for a sequence of functions) namely that of its partial sums 



In principle, it is therefore immaterial whether the terms of the series or its partial 
sums are assigned, as each set determines tht other uniquely. Thus, in principle, it 
also does not matter whether we speak of infinite series of variable terms or 
of sequences of functions. We shall accordingly state our definitions and 
theorems only for the case of series and leave it to the student to formulate them for 
the case of sequences of functions*. 

5. For the series

1 For the case of complex numbers and functions, we have here to substitute 
throughout the word region for the word interval and boundary points of the region 
for endpoints of the interval. With this modification, the sign o has the same sig- 
nificance in this chapter as previously. 

2 Occasionally, however, the definitions and theorems will also be applied 
to sequences of functions.

The series converges for every real x. Clearly, indeed, we have

If a given series of the form 2 f n (x) is convergent in a deter- 
minate interval /, there corresponds to every point of / a perfectly 
definite value of the sum of the series. This sum accordingly ( 19, 
Def. l) is itself a function of x, which is defined or represented by 
the series. When the latter function is the chief centre of interest, it 
is also said to be expanded in the series in question. In this sense, 
we write 



n=0 

In the case of power series and of the functions they represent 
(v. Chapters V and VI), these ideas are already familiar to us. 

The most important question to be solved, when a series of variable 
terms is given, will usually be whether, and to what extent, properties 
belonging to all the functions f n (%), i. e. to the terms of the given 
series, are transferred to its sum. 

Even the simple examples given above show that this need not 
be the case for any of the properties which are of particular interest 
in the case of functions. The geometric series shows that all the func- 
tions f n (x) may be bounded, without F (x) being so; the power series 
for sin a;, x > 0, shows that every f n (x) may be monotone, without 
F(x) being so; example 5 shows that every f n (x) may be continuous, 



46. Uniform convergence. 329 

without F(x) being so, and the same example illustrates the corres- 
ponding fact for differentiability. It is easy to construct an example 
showing that the property of integrability may also disappear. 
For instance, let 

{ = 1 for every rational x expressible as a fraction with denominator 
(positive and) < n, 
= for every other x . 

Then s n (x), for each n, and consequently f n (x), for each n, is intc- 
grable over any bounded interval, as it has only a finite number of discon- 
tinuities in such an interval (cf. 19, theorem 13) Also lim s n (x) = F (x) exists 

for every x. In fact, if x is rational, say = (?>0, p and q prime to one 

another), we have, for every n>q, s n (x) = l and hence F(x) = l. If, on 
the other hand, x is irrational, s n (a;) = for every n and so F(o;) = 0. Thus 
~fn ( x ) = lim s n (x) defines the function 

= 1 for a rational x, 

= for an irrational x. 

This function is not integrable, for it is discontinuous 3 for every x. 

Even by these few examples, we are led to see that a quite 
new category of problems arises with the consideration of series of 
variable terms. We have to investigate under what supplementary con- 
ditions this or the other property of the terms f n (x) is transferred to 
the sum F(x). It is clear from the examples cited that the mere fact of 
convergence does not secure this, the cause must reside in the 
mode of convergence. A concept of the greatest importance in this 
respect is that known as uniform convergence of a series 2 f n (x) in one 
of its intervals of convergence or in part of such an interval. 

This idea is easy to explain, but its underlying nature is not so 
readily grasped. We shall therefore first illustrate the matter somewhat 
intuitively, before proceeding to the abstract formulation: 

CO 

Let 2 f n (x) converge, and have for sum F(x), in an interval/, a <x<b- 
n=0 

we shall speak of the graph of the function y = s n (x) = f (x) -\ h f n (x) as 

being the nU* curve of approximation and of the graph of the function y = F(x) 

8 We may modify this definition a little by taking s n (x) = 1 for all rational 
xs whose denominators are factors of n^ and =0 elsewhere; the rational a?'s 
in question comprise, for each n, a definite number of other values besides 
the integers <w used above. We then obtain as lims n (#) the same function 
F(x) as above. In this case, however, both s n (x) and F(x) may be represent- 
ed in terms of a closed expression, by the usual means; in fact, we have 
$n (x) = lim (cos 2 nl nx) k t and therefore 

F(x) = lim [ lim (cos 2 n! ytx) k }. 



This curious example of a function, discontinuous everywhere, yet obtainable 
by a repeated passage to the limit from continuous functions, is due to 
Dirichlet.

00 

as the limiting curve. The fact of the convergence of f n (x) to F (x) in J 

n=o 

then appears to imply that for increasing- n, the curves of approximation lie 
closer and closer to the limiting curve. This, however, is only a very imper- 
fect description of what actually occurs. In fact, the convergence in / implies 
only, in the first instance, that at each individual point there is convergence; 
all we can say, to begin with, is therefore that when any definite abscissa x 
is singled out (and kept fixed) the corresponding ordinates of the curves oi 
approximation approach, as n increases, the ordinate of the limiting curve for 
the same abscissa. There is no reason why the curve y = s n (x) , as a whole, 
should lie closer and closer to the limiting curve. This statement sounds rather 
paradoxical, but an example will immediately make it clear. 

The series whose partial sums for n= 1, 2, ... have the values 



certainly converges in the interval 1 < x < 2 . In fact, in that interval, 



The limiting curve is therefore the stretch 1 < a; < 2 on the axis of x. The n** 
curve of approximation lies above this stretch and, by the above inequality, at a 

distance of less than from the limiting curve, throughout the whole of the 

interval 1 < x < 2 . For large n's, the distance all along the curve is therefore 
very small. 

In this case, therefore, matters are much as we should expect; the position is 
entirely altered if we consider the same series in the interval < x < 1 . We 
still have lim s n (x) = at every point of this interval 4 , so that the limiting 
curve is the corresponding poition of the a;- axis. But in this case the 
n** 1 approximation curve no longer lies close to the limiting curve through- 

out the interval, for any n (however large). For #== , we have always 
s n (a:) = , so that, for every n, the approximation curve in the interval from 

t 

to 1 has a hump of height ~ ! ! The graph of the curve y = S 4 (x) has the 

2 

following appearance: 




Fig. 4. 



4 In fact, for x > we have < s n (x) < as before, i. e. < e for 

n x 

every n > ; for x , s n (x) = even permanently. 

X 



The curve y 



46. Uniform convergence. 331 

), however, corresponds more nearly to the following graph: 



Fig. 5. 

For larger n's, the hump in question without diminishing in height be- 
comes compressed nearer and nearer to the ordinate-axis. The approximation 

curve springs more and more steeply upwards 5 from the origin to the height , 

Ci 

which it attains for x , only to drop down again almost as rapidly to 
n 

within a very small distance of the a; -axis. 

The beginner, to whom this phenomenon will appear very odd, should 
take care to get it quite clear in his mind that the ordmates of the approxima- 
tion curves do nevertheless, for every fixed x, ultimately shrink up to the point 
on the tf-axis, so that we do have, for every fixed x, lim s n (x) = 0* If x is 
given a fixed value (however small), the disturbing hump of the curve y=s n (x) 
will ultimately, i. e. for sufficiently large w's, be situated entirely to the left of 
the ordinate through x (though still to the right of the y-axis) and on this 
ordinate the curve will again have already dropped very close to the a;- axis*. 

Therefore the convergence of our series will be called uniform in the 
interval 1 < x < 2 , but not in the interval < x < 1 . 

We now proceed to the abstract formulation: Suppose 2f n (x) 
possesses an interval of convergence /; it is convergent for every indiv- 
idual point of /, for instance at X = X Q \ this means that if we write 
F(x) = s w (#) + r n ( x ] and assume > arbitrarily given, there is a 
number n Q such that, for every n > n , 



Of course the number n Q , as was already emphasized (v. 10, rem. 3), de- 
pends on the choice of e. But n Q now depends on the choice of X Q also. 
In fact for some points of / the series will in general converge more 



6 At the origin, its slope is s n '(Q) = n. 



8 If we take, say, x = y^r~ and n = 1000000, the abscissa of the highest 
point of the hump is ffinnftflft' and at our point * the curve has already dropped 



to a height < . 



332 Chapter XI. Series of variable terms. 

rapidly than for others 7 . By analogy with 10, 3, we shall therefore 
write w = w (e,a: ); or more simply, dispensing with the index and 
with the special emphasis on the dependence on e, we shall say: 
Given e > and given x in the interval /, a number n (x) can always 
be assigned, such that for every n > n (x) , 



If we now assume n(x) still for the definite given e chosen, 
say as an integer, as small as possible, its value is then uniquely 
defined by the value of x; as such it represents a function of #. In a 
certain sense, its value may be considered as a measure of the rapid- 
ity of convergence of the series at the point x. We now define as 
follows: 

191. Definition of uniform convergence (1 st form). The series 2f n (%) 
convergent in the interval f, is said to be uniformly convergent in the 
sub-interval ]' of /, if the function n(x) defined above is bounded in /', 
for each value 8 of e. Supposing we then have n (x) < N in / 
this N will of course depend on the choice of c, like the numbers 
n(x) themselves we may also say: 

2 nd (principal) form of the definition. A series 2f n (x), con- 
vergent in the interval J, is said to be uniformly convergent in a 
sub-interval /' of /, if, given e, a single number N = N(e) can be 
assigned independently of x, such that 



not only (as formerly) for every n>N, but also for every x in /'. 
We also say that the remainders r n (x) tend uniformly to in /'. 

Illustrations and Examples. 

1. Uniformity of convergence invariably concerns a whole interval, nevei 
an isolated point 9 . 

2. A series 2 f n (x) convergent in an interval / does not necessarily con- 
verge uniformly in any sub-interval of /. 

3. If the power series 2 a n (x X ) n has the positive radius r and if 

the series is uniformly convergent in the closed sub-interval /' of 



7 The student should compare, for instance, the rapidity of convergence 
of the geometric series 2x n (i. e. the rapidity with which the remainder diminishes 

1 99 

as n increases) for the values 3 = -^ and 05 = ^^^.

vergence evinces no unduly great irregularities in the interval /'. In par- 
ticular cases /' may of course consist of the complete interval /. 

9 More generally, it may have reference to sets of points more than finite

its interval of convergence, defined by < x x < + Q. In fact , as the point 
x *= #Q-}- li es m tne interior of the interval of convergence of the power series, 
the latter is absolutely convergent at that point. But if 2a n Q n converges 
absolutely, we can, given e ;> 0, choose N=N(e) so that for every n> N 

I +i \-e n+ * -f I *+2 1 -e n - M -h <. 

Also, since |a5 x Q \<Q for every a; in /', we have 



Thus for n ^> N, we certainly have | r n (x) \ O> whatever the position of x in 
/' may be . 

The result we have obtained is as follows 

o Theorem. A power series 2a n (x~x ) n of positive radius r converges uni- 
formly in every sub-interval of the form \ x X \ < Q < r of its interval of con- 
vergence. 

4. The above example enables us to make ourselves understood, if we 
formulate the definition of uniform convergence a little more loosely, as follows: 
2 f n (x) is said to be uniformly convergent in J', if it is possible to make a 
statement about the value of the remainder, in the form "\ r n (x) \ < *", valid for 
all positions of x simultaneously. 

5. The series 2 - 5 is uniformly convergent for every value of x\ 

n=l * 
for, whatever the position of x may be, 

~ 



whence the rest may be inferred by 4. 

(>. The geometric series is not uniformly convergent in the whole interval 
of convergence - 1 < x < -|- 1. For 



however large N may be chosen, we can always find an r n (x) with n "> N and 
< x < 1, for which e. g. r n (x) > 1. 

If, for instance, we choose any fixed n > N t then as x -> 1 we have 

x n+i 



Hence r n (x) > 1 for all x in a definite interval of the form x < x < 1. 

7. The above clears up the meaning of the statement : Sf n (x) is not uni- 
formly convergent in a portion J' of its interval of convergence. A special value 
of e, say the value e<j > 0, exists, such that an index n greater than any assigned 
N may be found, so that the inequality | r n (x) | < e is not satisfied for some suit- 
ably chosen x in J' . 

8. With reference to the curves of approximation y = s n (x) t our definition 
clearly implies that, with increasing n t the curve should lie arbitrarily close to the 
limiting curve throughout the portion which lies above J'. If, for any given e > 0, 
we draw the two curves y = F (x) e, the approximation curves y = s n (x) will 
ultimately, for every sufficiently large n, come to he entirely within the strip bounded 
by the two curves. 



334 Chapter XI. Series of variable terms. 

9. The distinction between uniform and non-uniform convergence, and the 
great significance of the former in the theory of infinite series, were first re- 
cognized (almost simultaneously) by Ph. L. v. Seidel (Abh. d. Mimch. Akad. r 
p. 383, 1848) and by G. G. Stokes (Transactions of the Cambridge Phil. Soc., 
Vol. 8, p. 533. 1848). It appears, however, from a paper by K. Weierstrass, un- 
published till 1894 (Werke, Vol. 1, p. 67), that the latter must have drawn the 
distinction as early as 1841. The concept of uniform convergence did not 
become common property till much later, chiefly through the lectures of 
Weierstrass. 

Other forms of the definition of uniform convergence. 

3 rd form. 2f n (x) is said to be uniformly convergent in J f ^f ) 
in whatever way we may choose the sequence 10 (x n ) in the interval J\ 
the corresponding remainders 



invariably form a null sequence 11 . 

We can verify as follows that this definition is equivalent to the 
preceding: 

a) Suppose that the conditions of the 2 nd form of the definition are 
fulfilled. Then, given e, we can always determine N so that | r n (x) \ < 6 
for every n > N and every x in /'; in particular 

I r n( x n) I < e * or ever y n> N; 
hence r n (x n )-+0. 

b) Suppose, conversely, that the conditions of the 3 rd form are ful- 
filled. Thus for every (o; n ) belonging to /' , r n (x n ) * . The conditions 
of the 2 nd form must then be satisfied also. In fact, if this were not 
the case, if a number N= -^(e) with the properties formulated there 
did not exist for every e > , this would imply that for some 
special e, say e = , no number N had these properties; above any 
number N, however large, there would be at least one other index n such 
that, for some suitable point x = x n in /', | r n (x n ) \ ^ e . Let n li be an 
index such that | r n (x n ) | ^ s . Above n l there would be another index 
2 , such that | r n2 (x n ^ \ ^ e for a suitable corresponding point x n ^ and 
so on. We can choose (x n ) mj' so that the points x n , x n ^ . . . belong to 
(x n ), in which case 



10 The sequence need not converge, but may occupy any position in./'. 

11 Should each of the functions | r n (x) \ attain a maximum in J' t we may 
choose x n in particular so that | r n (x n ) \ = Max | r n (x) \ ; our definition thus takes 
the special form: Zf n (x) is said to be uniformly convergent in /' if the maxima 
Max | r n (x) \ in J' form a null sequence. 

If the function | r n (x) \ does not attain a maximum in _/', it has, however, a 

definite upper bound /i w . We may also formulate the definition in the general form: 

Form 3 a. 2f n (x) is said to be uniformly convergent in J' if p n -> 0. (Proof?) 



46. Uniform convergence. 335 

will certainly not form a null sequence, contrary to hypothesis. Our assump- 
tion that the conditions of the 2 nd form could not be fulfilled is inadmissible; 
the 3 rd form of the definition is completely equivalent to the 2 nd . 

In the previous forms of the definition, it was always the remainder 
of the series which we estimated, the series being already assumed to con- 
verge. By using portions of the series instead of infinite remainders (v. 81) 
the definition of uniform convergence may be stated so as to include that 
of convergence. We obtain the following definition : 

4 th form. A series Ef n (x) is said to be uniformly convergent in the 
interval /' if, given s > 0, we can assign a number N = TV (e) depending 
only on e, and independent of x, such that 



for every n > N, every k^.1 and every x in /'. For if the conditions of 
this definition are satisfied, then it follows firstly (by 81) that f n (x) 
converges for each fixed x iny'. In the inequality, we may make k tend 
to QO, and we find that | r n (x) \ ^ e for each x in J'. Conversely, if 
| r n (x) | <g s for all n > N and all x in /', then for all these n, all k ^> 1, 
and all x in /', we have 

l/n+i (x) + +f n+k (x) | - | r n (x) - r n+k (x) I ^ 2 . 

This shows, however, that if the series Hf n (x) satisfies the conditions of 
the 4 th form, it also satisfies those of the 2 nd form, -and conversely. We 
may finally express this definition in the following form (cf. 8 la): 

5 th form. A series Sf n (x) is said to be uniformly convergent in the 
interval J' if, when positive integers k ly k 2 , & 3 , . . . and points x^ x 2J # a , . . . 
of J' are chosen arbitrarily, the quantities 

[/nfl (*n) +/n +2 (*n) + +/nf/r n (*n) ] 

invariably form a null sequence 12 .

of a sequence of portions, except that here we may substitute a different value of x 
in each portion. The statement we then obtain is: A series 2f n (x) is said to be 
uniformly convergent in J' if every sequence of portions of the series forms a null 
sequence. Similarly: A sequence of functions s n (x) is said to be uniformly conver- 
gent inj' if every difference-sequence is a null sequence.

val /: 1 < x < -f- 1 , in particular in the sub-interval /': < x < 1 . Here

The convergence in this interval is not uniform. It is not so even in /":

formly 13 . This may be made clear geometrically by examining the position 
of successive curves of approximation, as illustrated by the accompanying 
figure : 

For large values of n , the curve y ~ s n (x) 
remains, almost throughout the whole interval 
quite close to the #-axis, which represents the 
limiting curve. Just before the ordmate as = +l, 
it rises abruptly until it reaches its terminal 
point (1, 1). However large a value may be 
assumed for n, the curve y = s n (x) will never 
remain close to the limiting curve throughout 
the entire l * inter val y (or./'). 

3. In the preceding example, we could 
almost expect a priori that the convergence 
would not be uniform, as F(x) itself has a 
"jump" of height 1 at the endpoint of the interval. 
The case was different with the example treated 

on p. 330. An example similar to the latter, but even more striking, is the 

following: Consider the series for which

For a! = 0, we have s n (0) = , for every n\ for x =)= , the number e~~~* x * is 
positive and less than 1, so that (by 38,1) s n (x) *0. Our series is therefore 
convergent for every x and its sum is F(a;) = 0, i. e. the limiting curve coin- 
cides with the a; -axis. The convergence is not in the least uniform, however, 

if we consider an interval containing the origin. Thus, for x n = rr=-

For x n = f 1 g-J , we even have r n (x n ) -+ 1 . 



14 In spite of this, it is easy to see that for every fixed x (in < x < 1) 
the values s n (x) diminish to as n increases, so that the abrupt rise to the 
height 1 occurs to the right of x, however near x may be taken to + 1, provid- 
ed only that n is chosen sufficiently large.

the hump now increases indefinitely with n ; this is because 15 

~+ -r-OO. 

4. We i mst emphasize particularly that uniform convergence does not 
require each of the functions f n (x) to be individually bounded. The series 

L_ 1 4- a; -f x 2 + , for instance, is uniformly convergent in < x <i -~- , with 

x ' 

the sum ., j^ ., since the remainders have the value

The first term of this series (as also the limiting function) is not bounded in 
the interval in question. (Cf., however, theorem 4. below.) 

With a view to calculation with uniformly convergent series, it 
is convenient to formulate the following theorems specially, although 
the proofs are so simple that we may leave them to the reader: 



Theorem 1. // the p series 2f n ^ (x), 2 f n2 (x), . . ., 2f np (x) are, 
simultaneously, uniformly convergent in the same interval J, (p is a 
definite whole number), the series 2 f n (x) for which 



is also uniformly convergent in that interval, if c 19 c a , . . ., c denote 
any constants. (I. e.: Uniformly convergent series may be multiplied 
by constant factors and then added term by term?) 

Theorem 2. // 2f n (x) is uniformly convergent in J, so is the 
series 2 g(x}f n (x), where g(x) denotes any function defined and bounded 
in the interval /. (I. e.: A uniformly convergent series may be multi- 
plied term by term by a bounded function.) 

Theorem 3. // not merely 2f n (x), but H\f n (x}\ is uniformly 
convergent in /, then so is the series 2g n (x)f n (x), provided that when m 
is suitably chosen, the functions g m ^\(x], g m +*(x), ..., are uniformly 
bounded in J, i. e. provided we can find an integer m > and a 
number G > such that \ g n (x) \ < G for every x in J and every n > m. 
(7. e.: A series which still converges uniformly when its terms are taken 
in absolute value may be multiplied term by term by any functions 
all but a finite number of which, at most, are uniformly bounded 
in J.)

338 Chapter XI. Series of variable terms. 

Theorem 4. If Sf n (x) converges uniformly in /, then for a suitable 
m the functions f m+l (x), f m+2 (x), . . . are uniformly bounded in J and con- 
verge uniformly to 0. 

Theorem 5. If the functions g n (x) converge uniformly to inj, so 
do the functions y n (x) g n (x\ where the functions y n (x) are any functions 
defined in J and with the possible exception of a finite number of them 
uniformly bounded in J. 

We may give as a model the proofs of Theorems 3 and 4: 

Proof of Theorem 3. By hypothesis, given e > 0, we can de- 
termine n Q > m so that for every n > and every x in J y 



For the same n's and #'s we then have 

|ft+i/.+i + I 5S I g.+i I |/.+i I + < G (!/ ,-i I + . . .) < e. 
This proves all that was required. 

Proof of Theorem 4. By hypothesis, there exists an m such that, 
for every n ^ m and every x in y, | r n (x) \ < \. Hence for n > m and 
every x in /, 

I/. (*) I = I r.-i (*) - r n (x) | ^ | r.-! | + | r n | < 1, 

which proves the first part of the theorem. If we now choose n Q > m so 
that for every n ^ n Q and every x in J, | r n (x) | < i e, (e being previously 
assigned) the second part follows in quite a similar way.

^ * 

Whereas we saw on pp. 328 9 that the fundamental properties of 
the functions f n (x) do not in general hold for the function F (x) repre- 
sented by 2f n (x), we shall now show that, roughly speaking, this mil 
be the case when the series is uniformly convergent 16 . 

We first give the following simple theorem, which becomes particularly 
important in applications: 

193. Theorem 1. // the series 2f n (x) is uniformly convergent in an 
interval and if its terms f n (x) are continuous at a point x n of this interval^ the 
function F (x) represented by the series is also continuous at this point 17 . 



16 We may, however, mention at once that uniform convergence still only 
represents a sufficient condition in the following theorems and is not in general 
necessary. 

17 If x is an endpoint of the interval y, only one-sided continuity can of course 
be asserted at X Q for F (x), but of course only the corresponding one-sided con- 
tinuity need be assumed at x for / n (x). 



47. Passage to the limit term by term. 339 

Proof. Given s > 0, we have (in accordance with 19, Def. 6b) 
to show that a number d = d (e) > exists such that 

| F (x) F (x ) | < e for every x with | z X Q \ < 8 
in the interval. Now we may write 

F(x) - F(* )= s n (x) - sM + r n (x) - r n (x Q ). 

By the assumed fact of uniform convergence, we can choose n = m so 
large that, for every x in the interval, | r m (x) \ < . Then 



The integer m being thus determined, s m (x) is the sum of a fixed 
number of functions continuous ata? , and is therefore (by 19, Theorem 3) 
itself continuous at X Q . We can accordingly choose 6 so small that 
for every x in the interval for which )# X Q \ < (5, we have 



For the same x's we then have 



which establishes the continuity of F(x) at a; . 

Corollary. // 2f n (x] = F(s) is uniformly convergent in an interval, 
and if the functions f n (x\ are all continuous throughout the interval, 
then so is F(x). ' 

In connection with example 3 of 191,2, we have in the above a fresh 
proof of the continuity of the function represented by a power series in its in- 
terval of convergence. 

If we use the lim-defmition of continuity (v. 19, Def. 6) instead 
of the e- definition, the statement of the theorem may be put into the 
form: 

"m ( jy n (X)) 



n=0 



In this form it appears as a special case of the following much more 
elaborate theorem: 



Theorem 2. We assume that the series F(x) = ^f n (x) is uni- 194. 

n=o 
formly convergent in the open interval 18 x . . . x l and that the limit, 

when x approaches X Q from the interior of the interval 19 , 

lim /(*) = * 



18 X Q may be > or < #, . Whether the series remains convergent at a? , 
and indeed whether the functions f n (a;) are defined there at all, is immaterial 
for the present theorem. 

19 We are therefore concerned here, as also in the two subsequent state- 
ments, with a one-sided limit.

exists. The series 21 a n ^ en converges and\imF(x), when x+x in 

n o 

the above manner, exists. Moreover , if we write 2a n = A , we have 

lim F(a) A, 
or, otherwise, 



n=0 



(The latter form is expressed shortly by saying: In the case of uni- 
form convergence , we may proceed to the limit term by term.) 

Proof. Given e > 0, first choose w , (v. 4 th form of the defini- 
tion 191) so that for every n > x , every k ^> 1 and every x in our 
interval, 



Let us for the moment keep n and k fixed, and make x+x . By 
19, Theorem la, it follows that 



And this is true for every n > n and every & ^> 1. Hence 2 a n is 
convergent. Let us denote the partial sums of this series by A n and 
its sum by A. It is easy to see now that F(x) >A. If, for a given e, 
n Q is determined so that, for every n > w , we not only have 



then, for a (fixed) m > n , 

|F(*)-4| 

= !(*.(*) - A J ~(A- ^+r m (x)\^\s m (x) - A m \ +-5- 
As a; *-a? involves 5 m (a?) >^4 m , we can determine 5 so that 



for every x belonging to the interval, such that < | x X Q \ < d . 
For these a; f s, we then also have 

\F(x)-A\<*, 

which proves all that we required. 

If (o; n ) is chosen arbitrarily in the interval of uniform convergence, it 
follows from 



and n, (a? n ) -* (v. 191, 3 rd form) that the sequences F(x n ) and s n (x n ) will in- 
variably exhibit the same behaviour as regards convergence or divergence, and 
that if they converge, the limits will coincide. We may contrast this with the case 



47. Passage to the limit term by term 



of the series, already seen to be non-umformly convergent, whose partial sums 
are s n (x) -r~ir~ir~* If here we take x n , we have F (x n ) = 0, i. e. it is con- 

vergent with the limit 0, whereas s n (x n ) J, i. e. it also converges, but with the 
limit J. The two sequences do not have the same behaviour. 

Theorem 3. The series F(x) = Ef n (x) is assumed uniformly con- 195. 
vergent in the interval/, and all the functions f n (x) are supposed integrable 
over the closed sub-interval /': a ^ x ^ b, so that F (x) is also continuous 
in that sub-interval. Then F (x) is also integrable over J' and the integral of 
F (x) over the interval/' may then be obtained by term-by -term integration , i . e.

(More precisely: The series on the right hand side is also convergent and 
has for its sum the required integral of F (x). 

Proof. Given s > 0, we determine m so large that for every n > m 
and every x in a ... b, 



f

Since s m (x) is the sum of a finite number of integrable functions, it is 
itself integrable over/'. By 19, theorem 11, we can therefore divide 
the interval J' into p parts t l9 i 2 , . . . , ij> such that, if ov denotes the oscil- 
lation of s m (x) in it, , we have

Now the oscillation of r m (x) is certainly < 2 ?7, 1:~S > ky t ^ ie manner ' n 

which m was determined. Also the oscillation of the sum of two functions 
is never greater than the sum of the oscillations of the two functions. So 
for the same subdivision i l9 i 2 , . . . , i v of the interval a . . . b, we have 



i v 



< e, 



where v v denotes the oscillation of .F (x) in *" . Thus (again by 19, theorem 
11) F(x) also is integrable over/'. Furthermore, as F = s n + r n> we have, 
for every n^m,

the latter by 19, theorem 21. Now s n (x) is the sum of a finite number

Tliis, however, implies the convergence of 2 J f v (x)dx and the iden- 

a 

tity of its sum with the corresponding integral of F(x). 

Matters are not so simple in the case of term-by-term differen- 
tiation. 

In 190, 7, we saw, for instance, that the series 



converges for every #, and so represents a function F(x) defined for every 
real x. The terras of this series are, without exception, continuous and dilfer- 
entiable functions. If we differentiate term by term, we obtain the series 

00 

2 cos n x , 
n = l 

which is divergent 20 for every x. - Even if a series converges uniformly 
for every x, as for instance the series 



(cf. Kxample 5, 191, 2), the position is no better, since on differentiating term 
by term we obtain 

V cos n x 
~i n 
a series which diverges e. g. for x = Q. 

The theorem on term-by-term differentiation must accordingly be 
of a different stamp. It runs as follows: 

CO 

196. Theorem 4. Given 21 a series E f n (x) whose terms are differen-

deduced from it by differentiating term by term, converges uniformly

one point of J. Further t if F(x) and (p(x)are the functions represented 
by the, two series, F(x) is differentiable f and we have 

*(*)-?(*). 

In other words, with the given hypotheses, the series may be differ- 
entiated term by term.

21 As regards the convergence of the series, no assumption is made in 
the first instance. 



47. Passage to the limit term by term. 343 

Proof, a) Let c denote a point of / (existent by hypothesis) for 
which 2f n (c) converges. By the first mean value theorem of the 
differential calculus ( 19, theorem 8) 



2 (/,(*)- (<)) = (*- c)' 2 //(), 

v=n+l r-n + l 

where f denotes a suitable point between x and c. Given e > 0, we 
can, by hypothesis, choose n so that for every n > n Q , every k ^> 1, 
and every x in J, 



6 a ' 

Under the same conditions, we therefore have 

< e. 



n+fc 

27 ( 

r=n H 



This shows that 2(f n (x) f n (c)), and hence Sf n {x) itself, is uniformly 
convergent in the whole interval / and accordingly represents a de- 
finite function F(x) in that interval. 

b) Now let X Q be a special point of / and write 

A(*o + A)-A.(*o) = gy(/t)> (,, = 0,1,2,...). 

These functions are defined for every h^O for which X Q -f- & belongs 
to /. As above, we may write 

n + ls n+fc 

27 ^ (*) = 27 /;'(* + **) (o < * < i) 

r=fl y=+l 

and we find, as in a), that w 

27 ^ n W 

n=0 

converges uniformly for all these values of h. This series represents 
the function 



h 

By theorem 2, we may let h >0 term by term, and we conclude that 
F* ( x o) ex i sts > Wlt ^ 

^(*o) = 270 ft, (*)) = 

n=0 A->0 n=0 



This signifies that F*(x ) = q>(x ), as asserted. 



Examples and Remarks. 

1. If a n (x xj* has the radius f>0 and if < ^ < r, the series 
(a? sfy)*"" 1 converges uniformly for every | x x \ < Q. By theorem 4, the 
given power series accordingly represents a function which is differentiable for 
every \x X Q \<Q. For any particular x, with \x # | < r, which we may 
choose to consider, we can determine p < r so that | x X \ <C g < r. The 



344 Chapter XI. Series of variable terms. 

function represented by 2a n (x-~x ) n therefore remains differentiable at every 
point of the open interval | x x | < r. 

2. The function represented by ^ - - is differentiable for every x 



and its derived function is - ^ . (Cf, Example 5, 191, 2.) 

n = l n 

3. The condition of uniform convergence is certainly sufficient in all 
four theorems. But it remains questionable whether it is also necessary. 

a) In the case of the continuity -theorem 1 or its corollary, this is cert- 
ainly not so. The scries considered in 192, 2 and 4 have everywhere-con- 
tinuous terms and represent everywhere-continuous functions themselves. Yet 
their convergence was not uniform. The framing- of necessary and sufficient 
conditions is not exactly easy. S. ArzelA (Rendiconti Accad. Bologna, (1), Vol. 19, 
p. 85. 1883) was the first to do so in a satisfactory manner. A simplified 
proof of the main theorem enunciated by him will be found in G. Vivanti 
(Rendiconti del circ. matem. di Palermo, Vol. 30, p 83. 1910). In the case in 
which the functions / (x) are positive t it has been shown by V. Dim that uni- 
form convergence is also necessary for the continuity of F(x). Cf. Ex. 158. 

b) The fact that in theorem 195 on term-by-term integration uniform 
convergence is again not a necessary condition may also be verified by various 

CO 

examples. Taking the series fn ( x ) discussed on pp. 330-1, whose partial 

n=i 
sums are 

. nx 



and whose sum is F(a?) = 0, we see at once that 



v=l 00 

Thus term-by-tcrm integration leads to the correct result. In the case of the 

i 

series 192,3, however, in which we also have J F(x) dx = 0, term-by-term 

o 
integration gives, on the contrary, 



In this case, therefore, term-by-term integration is not allowed. 



48. Tests of uniform convergence. 

Now that we are acquainted with the meaning of the concept 
of uniform convergence, we shall naturally inquire how we can de- 
termine whether a given series does or does not converge uniformly 
in the whole or a part of its interval of convergence. However 
difficult it may be and we know it often is so to determine 
the mere convergence of a given series, the difficulties will of course 
be considerably enhanced when the question of uniform convergence 



48. Tests of uniform convergence. 345 

is approached. The lest which is the most important for applications, be- 
cause it is the easiest to handle, is the following: 

Weierstrass 9 test. // each of the functions f n (x) is defined and 197. 
bounded in the interval /, say 



throughout J and if the series 2y n (of positive terms) converges, the 
series 2f n (*t) converges uniformly in J. 

Proof. If the sequence (# n ) is chosen arbitrarily in /, we have 



By 81, 2, the right hand side *0 when n *oo; hence so does 
the left. By 191, 5 th form, 2 f n (x) is therefore uniformly conver- 
gent in /. 

Examples. 

1. In the example 191, 3 we have already made use of the substance of 
Weierstrass* test. 

2. The harmonic series Jj? , which converges for x >1, is uniformly 



convergent on the semi-axis #>l + <5, where d is any positive number. In 
fact, for such s's, 



1 



< 



1 



where 2y n converges. This proves the statement. 

The function represented by the harmonic series known as Riemann's 
^-function and denoted by (a) is therefore certainly continuous for every 2a 
x> 1. 

3. Differentiating the harmonic series term by term, we deduce the series 



This again is uniformly convergent m#^>l-|-<5>l. In fact, for every suffi- 
logn 

n 6 
we then have 

1 log n 1 

<C 7T~ 



ciently large n, -<1 (by 38,4); for these n's and for every #> 



n 

Riemann's f -function is accordingly difFerentiable for every x > 1, and its derivative 
is represented by the series (*). 

4. If 27 a n converges absolutely, the series 

2 a n cos n x and 2 a n sin n x 

are uniformly convergent for every x, since e. g. | a n cos n x \ ^ a n = y w . These 
series accordingly define functions continuous everywhere. 

In spite of its great practical importance, Weierstrass* test will 
necessarily be applicable only to a restricted class of series, since it 

22 In fact, if we consider a special x > 1, we can always assume 8 > chosen 
so that x > 1 + 8. 



346 Chapter XI. Series of variable terms. 

requires in particular that the scries investigated should converge 
absolutely. When this is not the case, we have to make use of more 
delicate tests, which we construct by analogy with those of 43. The 
most powerful means for the purpose is again Abel's partial summation 
formula. On lines quite similar to those already followed, we first ob- 
tain from it the 

00 

198. Theorem. A series of the form 2 a n ( x }'^n( x } certainly converges 

n-^O 

uniformly in the interval /, if, in /, 

00 

1) 2jA v -(b p b v+1 ) is uniformly convergent (as a series) and 

v=0 

2) (A n -6 n + 1 ) is uniformly convergent (as a sequence) 2 *. 

Here the functions A n = A n (x) denote the partial sums of 2 a n (x). 

Proof. As formerly we have merely to interpret the quant- 
ities a v , b v and A v as no longer numbers, but functions of a; we 
first have 

n+k n+fc 

2*, \ = 2A r -(b r -b r ^) + (A n+t .b n+1l+1 -A n .b n+1 }. 

v^n-t-1 r=n+l 

Letting x and k vary in any manner with n, we have on the left z 
sequence of portions 



of the series 2 a v b v , and on the right the corresponding one relative 
to the series 2A v (b v & y+1 ), and a difference-sequence of the sequence 
G^n'^n+i)' Since by hypothesis the latter sequences always tend to 
(v. 191, 5 th form), it follows that so does the sequence on the left. 
This (again by 191, 5), proves the statement 

Exactly as in 43, the above theorem, which is still very general 
in character, leads to the following more special, but more easily man- 
ageable tests 24 : 

1. Abel's test. 2 a v (x) b v (x} is uniformly convergent in /, 
if 2a v (x) converges uniformly in /, if further, for every fixed value 
of x, the numbers b n (x) form a real monotone sequence 25 and if, for 



23 fl n , b n , A n are now always functions of x defined in the interval /; only 
for brevity we often leave the variable x unmentioned. For the notion of the 
uniform convergence of a sequence of functions cf. 190, 4. 

24 For simplicity's sake, we name these criteria after the corresponding ones 
for constant terms. Cf. p. 315, footnote 8.

every n and every x in J, the functions b n (x) are less in absolute 
vahie than one and the same number 28 K. 

Proof. Let us denote by a n (x) the remainder corresponding to 

oo 

the partial sum A n (x); i.e. a v (x] = A n (x) + #(#) In the formula

of Abel's partial summation, we may (by the supplement 183) sub- 
stitute u for A r , and we obtain

it therefore again suffices to show that both 2a v (b v b v + l ) and 
(a n -& n + 1 ) converge uniformly in /. However, the# n (#/s, as remainders 
of a uniformly convergent series, tend uniformly to and the b v (xjs 
remain < K in absolute value for every x in /; it follows that (a n 'b n + 1 ) 
also converges uniformly to in /. On the other hand, if we con- 
sider the portions

we can easily show that these tend uniformly to in /, thereby 
completing the proof of the uniform convergence in / of the series 
under discussion. In fact, if a v denotes the upper bound of a v (x) in /,

Proof. The hypotheses and 192, 5 immediately involve the 
uniform convergence (again to 0) of (A n 'b n + :L ). If, further, K' denotes

for a fixed n, however, b n (x) is a function of x, defined in /. The above as- 
sumption may, then, be expressed as follows: All the sequences, for the various 
values of x, shall be uniformly bounded with regard to all these values of x\ 
in other words, each one is bounded and there is a number K which is 
simtdtaneously a bound above for them all. Or again: All the functions defined 
in / for the various values of n shall be uniformly bounded with regard to 
all these values of n\ i. e. each function is bounded, and a number J\ exists 
which simultaneously exceeds them all in absolute value.

In whatever way x and & may depend on n, the right hand side will 
tend to by the hypotheses, hence also the left. This proves the uni- 
form convergence in / of the series under consideration. 

The monotony of the convergence of b n (x) for fixed x has only 
been used in each of these tests to enable us to obtain convenient 
upper estimations of the portions 2\b y b v + l \. By slightly modifying 
the hypotheses with the same end in view, we obtain 

3. Two tests of du Bois-Reymond and Dedekinrt. 

a) The series 2 a v (x) b v (x) is uniformly convergent in J, if both 
2 a v and 2 \ b v & v+ i | converge uniformly in J and if, at the same 
time, the functions b n (x) are uniformly bounded in /. 

Proof. We use the transformation 

n+k n+k 



As the remainders cc y (x) now converge uniformly to 0, we have, for 
every v > m, say, and every x in /, | <*(#)! < 1. Hence for every

the expression on the right even if x and k are made to depend 
on n, in any manner now tends to as n increases, hence so 
does the expression on the left. That # M -& nfl tends uniformly to

6 n (oj)'s are uniformly bounded in /. 

b) The series S a v (x) b v (x) is uniformly convergent in J if the 
series S\b v b v+1 \ converges uniformly in J y and the series 27 a v has uni- 
formly bounded partial sums, provided the functions b n (x) -> uniformly 
in J. 

Proof. From the hypotheses, it again follows at once that A n b n Hl 
converges uniformly (to 0) in /. Further, if K' once more denotes a 
number greater than all the |^ n ()|'s for every x,

\vill often reduce to a constant, for every n\ it will usually be the former. 

Now a series of constant terms 2 a v must, if it converges, of couisc be re- 
garded as uniformly convergent in every interval; for, its terms being independent 
of #, so are its portions, and any upper estimation valid for the latter is 
valid ipso facto for every x. Similarly the partial sums of a series of constant 
terms 2a y , if bounded, must be accounted uniformly bounded m every interval^ 

2. Let (a n ) be a sequence of numbers with -T n convergent, and let 
b n (x) = x n . The series 2a n x n is uniformly convergent in < x < 1 , for the 
conditions of AbeV test are fulfilled in this interval. In fact, 2a n , as re- 
marked in 1., is uniformly convergent; fuither, for every fixed x in the inter- 
val, (x n ) is monotone and | z n | < 1. By the theorem 194 on term-by-terin 
passage to the limit, we may therefore conclude that 

lim (2a n x") = (lim a n x n ), i. e. 



This gives a fresh proof of Abel's limit theorem 100.

In fact, by 185,5, the partial sums of 2a n (x) are uniformly bounded 
in the interval /we may take K --- - \ and b n (x) tends monotonely to 0, 



uniformly, because b n does not depend on a:. If (b n ) denotes any monotone 
null sequence, it follows for the same reason that 

,2" b n cos n x and S b n sin n x 

are uniformly convergent in the same intervals (cf. 185, 5). All these series 
accordingly represent functions which are defined and continuous 28 for every 



87 Or in intervals obtained from the above by displacement through 
an integral multiple of 2 jr. 

28 Every fixed x ={= 2 k n may indeed be regarded as belonging to an inter- 
val of the above form, if 8 is suitably chosen (cf. p. 343, example 1, and p. 345, 
footnote).

cannot at once determine, not even in the case of the series 27 b n sin n x t although 
it certainly converges at these points (cf. 216, 4). 

49. Fourier series. 
A. Euler's formulae. 

Among the fields to which we may apply the considerations developed 
in the preceding sections, one of the most important, and also one of the 
most interesting in itself, is provided by the theory of Fourier series, and 
more generally by that of trigonometrical series, into which we now pro- 
pose to enter 29 . 

By a trigonometrical series is meant any series of the form 

1 

2 a Q + 2 (a n cos n x + b n sin n x), 

w=i 

with constant 30 a n and b n . If such a series converges in an interval of 
the form c^x<c + 2Tr, it converges, in consequence of the periodicity 
of the trigonometrical functions, for every real #, and accordingly represents 
a function defined for all values of x and periodic with the period 2 TT. We 
have already come across trigonometrical series convergent everywhere, 
for instance, the series, occurring a few lines back, 



^ ~ t ^ ., 

.fr-~' a 0; B ?r~^~' a 1; etc - 

We have never been in a position, so far, to determine the sum of any 
of these series for all values of x. It will appear very soon, however, that 
trigonometrical series are capable of representing the most curious types 
of functions such as one would not have ventured to call functions 
at all in Euler's time, as they may exhibit discontinuities and irregularities 
of the most complicated description, so that they seem rather to represent 
a patchwork of several functions than to form one individual function. 

29 More or less detailed and extensive accounts of the theory are to be found 
in most of the larger text books on the differential calculus (in particular, that 
referred to on p. 2, by H. v. Mangoldt and K. Knopp, Vol. 3, 8 th ed., Part 8, 1944). 
For separate accounts, we may refer to H. Lebesgue, Lecons sur les series tngono- 
me'triques, Paris 1906, and to the particularly elementary Introduction to the 
theory of Fourier's series, by M. Backer, Annals of Math. (2), Vol. 7, pp. 81 152. 
1906. A particularly detailed account of the theory is given by E. W. Hobson, The 
theory of functions of a real variable and the theory of Fourier series, Cambridge, 
2 ud ed., Vol. 1, 1921, and Vol. 2, 1926. The comprehensive works of L. Tonelli, 
Sene trigonometnche, Bologna 1928, and A. Zygmund, Trigonometrical series, 
Warsaw 1935, are quite modern treatments; the little volume by W. Rogostnski, 
Fouriersche Reihen, Sammlung Goschen 1930, is particularly attractive and con- 
tains a wealth of matter. 

80 It is only for reasons of convenience that a Q is written instead of a .

Fig. 8. 

In either case, the graph of the function consists of separated stretches 
(unclosed at either end) and of isolated points. 

However, the circumstance that simple trigonometrical series such 
as the above are capable of representing functions which are them- 
selves altogether discontinuous and "pieced together", is precisely what 
was chiefly responsible for the thorough revision to which the concept 
of function, and thence the whole foundation of analysis, came to be 
subjected at the beginning of the 19 th century. We shall see that 
trigonometrical series are capable of representing most of the so-called 
"arbitrary functions" 31 ; in this respect, they constitute a far more 
powerful instrument in higher analysis than power series. 

81 Of course the concept of an "arbitrary function" is not sharply defined. 
The term usually denotes a function which cannot be assigned by means of 
a single closed, formula (i. e. one avoiding the use of limiting- processes) in terms 



352 Chapter XI. Series of variable terms. 

We will mention only incidentally that the range of this instru- 
ment is by no means restricted to pure mathematics Quite the con- 
trary: such scries were first obtained in theoretical physics, in the 
course of investigations on periodic motion, i. e. chiefly in acoustics, 
optics, electrodynamics, and the theory of heat; Fourier, in his 
Thorie de la chaleur (1822) instituted the first more thorough study 
of certain trigonometrical series, although he did not discover any 
of the fundamental results of their theory. 

What functions can be represented by trigonometrical series and by 
what means can we obtain the representation of a given function, sup- 
posing this to be feasible? 

In order to lead up to a solution of this question, let us first 
assume that we have been able to represent a particular function f(x) 
by a trigonometrical series convergent everywhere: 



On account of the periodicity of the sine and cosine functions, 
f(x) is then necessarily periodic with the period 2n, and it is suffi- 
cient, therefore, to consider any interval of length 2n. We choose this 
interval, for all that follows, to be < x <j 2 n, where one of the end- 
points inay, moreover, be omitted. 

The function f(x) is then represented in this interval by a con- 
vergent series of continuous functions. We know that f(x) may none 
the less be discontinuous, although it also will be continuous if the 
series in question converges uniformly in the interval For the moment, 
we will assume this to be the case. 

With these hypotheses, we obtain a relationship between f(x) and 
the coefficients a n and b n which was conjectured by Euler: 



of the so-called elementary functions alone, i. e. in particular, it denotes a 
function which is apparently built up from separate portions of simple func- 
tions of this type, like the functions given as examples in the text, or the 
following, defined for every real x: 



for irrational x 
x for rational x , 

etc. Cf., however, the "arbitrary" function expressed by means of limiting 
processes on p 329, footnote. Not until it was found that even a perfectly 
"arbitrary" function such as these could be represented by a single (relatively 
simple) expression, as for instance by our trigonometrical series or by other 
limiting processes, did any necessity arise for regarding it as being actually 
one function, instead of a mere patchwork of several functions.

Let us multiply the series for /"(#), which is uniformly convergent 
in 0<^x<^2n, by cospx; by 192,2 the uniformity of the conver 
gence is not destroyed, and after performing the multiplication we 
may accordingly (v. 195) integrate term by term from to 2n. 
We immediately obtain:

32 In consequence of the periodicity of cos re and sin a;, it is then, ipso 
facto, uniformly convergent for every x. 

88 This designation is a purely conventional one; historical remarks are 
given by H. Lebesgue, loc. cit., p. 23; A. Sachse, Versuch einer Geschichte der 
trigonometrischen Reihen, Inaug.-Diss., Gottingen 1879; P. du Bois-Reymond, in 
his answer to the last-named paper; as well as very extensively by H. Burk- 
hardt, Trigonometrische Reihen und Integrale bis etwa 1850 (Enzyklop. d. math. 
Wiss., Vol. II, 1, Parts 7 and 8, 191415). 

84 We have only to transform the product of the two functions in the 
integrand into a sum in accordance with the known addition theorems, 

fe. g. cos p x cos q x = -jr- [cos (/> q) x + cos (p + q) xn , in order to be able to 
integrate straight away.

for the remaining terms give, on integration, the value 0. In the same 
way, multiplying the assumed expansion of f(x) by sinpx and then 
integrating, we at once deduce the second of Eider's formulae 



2 Jt 

b p = I f(x)s'mpxdx. 



The value of this theorem is diminished by the number of 
assumptions required to carry out the proof. Also, it gives no indi- 
cation how to determine whether a given function can be expanded in 
a trigonometrical series at all, or, if it can, what the values of the 
coefficients will be. 

However, the theorem suggests the following mode of procedure: 
Let f(x) be an arbitrary function defined in the interval <[ x <J 2 n, 
and integrable in Riemann's sense in the interval. In that case the 
integrals in Euler's formulae certainly have a meaning, by 19, 
theorem 22, and give definite values for a n and b n . We therefore 
note that these numbers, exist, on the single hypothesis that f(x) is 

integrable. The numbers -^- a Q , a lf a^, . . . and b 13 b 9 ... thus defined 

by Euler's formulae will be called the Fourier constants or Fourier 
coefficients of the function f(x). The series 

-?r &(\ + J? f # cos n x 4- b sin n x) 

2 ^ n ~^ n ^ " ' 

may now be written down, although this implies nothing as regards 
its possible convergence. This series will be called (without reference 
to its behaviour or to the value of its sum, if existent) the Fourier 
aeries generated by, or belonging to, f(x) 9 and this is expressed 
symbolically by 

/()~4- 



This formula accordingly implies no more than that certain constants 
a n> b n > have been deduced from f(x) (assumed only to be integrable) 
by means of Euler's formulae, and that then the above series has been 
written down 35 . 



3i The symbol "/-v/" has of course no connection here with the symbol 
introduced in 4O, Definition 5, for "asymptotically proportional". There is no 
fear of confusion. 



49. Fourier series. A. Euler's formulae. 355 

From theorem 1. and the manner in which this series was derived, 
we have, it is true, some justification for the hope that the series may 
converge and have f(x) for its sum. 

Unfortunately, this is not the case in general. (Examples will be 
met with very shortly.) On the contrary, the series may not converge 
in the whole interval, nor even at any single point; and if it does so, 
the sum is not necessarily f(x). It is impossible to say off-hand 
when the one or the other case may occur; it is this circumstance which 
prevents the theory of Fourier series from being entirely a simple subject, 
but which, on the other hand, renders it extraordinarily fascinating; 
for here entirely new problems arise, and we are faced with a funda- 
mental property of functions which appears to be essentially new in 
character: the property of producing a Fourier series whose sum is 
equal to the function itself. The next task is then to elucidate the 
connection between this new property and the old ones, viz. con- 
tinuity, monotony, differentiability, mtegrability, and so on. More con- 
cretely stated, the problems which arise are therefore as follows: 

1. Is the Fourier series of a given (integrable) function f(x) con- 
vergent for some or all values of x in < x <T 2 n ? 

2. // it converges, does the Fourier series of f(x) have for its 
sum the value of the generating function ? 

3. If the Fourier series converges at all points of the interval 
u^ x ^P> is the convergence uniform in this interval? 

As it is conceivable that a trigonometrical expansion of f(x) might 
be obtained by other means than that of Euler's formulae, we may 
also raise the further question at once: 

4. 7s it possible for a function which is capable of expansion in 
a trigonometrical series to possess several such expansions, in par- 
ticular, can it possess another trigonometrical expansion besides the 
possible Fourier expansion provided by Euler's formulae? 

It is not very easy to find answers to all these questions; in 
fact no complete answer to any of them is known at the present day. 
It would take us too far to treat all four questions in accordance with 
modern knowledge. We shall turn our attention chiefly to the first 
two; the third we shall touch on only incidentally, and we shall leave 
the last almost entirely out of account 36 . 

36 It should be noted, however, that the fourth question is answered under 
extremely general hypotheses by the fact that two trigonometrical series which 
converge in ^ x ^ 2 TT cannot represent the same function in that interval 
without being entirely identical. And if/(#), the function represented, is integrable 
over . . . 2 TT, its Fourier coefficients are equal to the coefficients of the trigono- 
metrical expansion; cf. G. Cantor (J. f. d. reine u. angew. Math., Vol. 72, p. 139. 
1870) and P. du Boit-Reymond (Munch. Abh., Vol. 12, Section I, p. 117. 1870). 



356 Chapter XI. Series of variable terms. 

With the designations introduced above, the content of Theorem 1 
may be expressed as follows: 

Theorem la. If a trigonometrical series converges uniformly in 
5^ x 5^ 2 TT (t. e. for all #), it is the Fourier series of the function repre- 
sented by it, and this function 37 admits of no other representation by a trigono- 
metrical series converging uniformly in ^ x < 2 TT. 

The fact that the Fourier scries of an integrable function does not neces- 
sarily converge will be seen further on; that even when it does converge, it need 
not have / (<v) for its sum, is obvious from the fact that two different functions f (x) 
and / 2 (x) may very well have identically the same Fourier constants ; in fact two 
integrable functions have the same integral (and therefore the same Fourier con- 
stants; i. e. the same Fourier series), if they coincide, for instance, for all rational 
values of x, \\ithout coinciding everywhere (v. 19, theorem 18). The fact that 
in an interval of convergence the series need not converge uniformly is shown by 

the example already used above; for the series J converges everywhere 

(v. 185, f>), and if the convergence were uniform, say in the interval 8 ^ x ^ 8, 
8 0, it would have to represent a continuous function in that interval, by 193. 
This is not the case, however, as we mentioned before on p. 351 and will prove 
later on p. 375. 

These few remarks suffice to show that the questions formulated 
above are not of a simple nature. In answering them, we shall follow 
the line adopted by G. Lejeune-Dirichlet, who took the first notable step 
towards a solution of the above questions, in his paper Sur la convergence 
des series trigonometriques 38 . 



B. Dirichlet's integral. 

We proceed to attack the first of the proposed problems, namely, 
the question of convergence: 

If the Fourier series - a + E (a n cos n x + b n sin n x) generated by 
2i 

a given integrable function /(#), i. e. with coefficients given in terms 
of f(x) by Euler's formulae, is to converge at the point x = X Q , its 
partial sums 

1 " 

+ b v sin v X Q ) 



must tend to a limit when n -> + oo . It is often possible to determine 
whether or no this is the case, by expressing s n (x ) in the form of a definite 
integral as follows: 



87 This function is then (by 193, Corollary) everywhere continuous.

We now take the important step of replacing the sum of the (n -f- 1) terms 
in brackets by a single closed expression. We have indeed 40 for every

Moreover the above formula continues to hold for z = 2 A JT , provided we attrib- 
ute to the ratio on the right hand side the limiting value for z 
i. e. the value wcosct.

Finally, we may transform this expression somewhat. The function

49. Fourier series. B. Dirichlet's integral. 359 

Our function f(x) is now defined for all real values of x and we have 
arranged for it to be periodic with period 2n. Now for any function 
(p (x) periodic with period 2n, we have (by 19, theorem 19), what- 
ever the values of c and c' may be,

This is Dirichlet's integral* 3 , by which the partial sums of the Fourier 
series generated by f(x) may be expressed. We may therefore state, 
as our first important result, the theorem: 

Theorem 2. In order that the Fourier series generated by a junc- 
tion f(x), integrable (hence bounded) and periodic with period 2n, may

Let us denote this sum by S(X Q ). The second question (p. 355), 
concerning the sum of the Fourier series, when convergent, may be 
included in our present considerations and our result may be put in a 
form still more advantageous in the sequel, by expressing the quantity 
S(X Q ) in the form of a Dirichlet integral also. As

should tend to 0, where for brevity we have put 



Although this theorem by no means solves questions 1 and 2 in such 
a manner that the answer in given concrete cases lies ready to hand, yet 
it furnishes an entirely new method of attack for their solution. Indeed 
the same may be said with regard to the third of the questions proposed 
on p. 355, for theorem 2 a may at once be modified to the following: 

Theorem 3. On the assumption that the partial sums s n (x) converge 
to s (x) at every point of the interval a 5^ x 5^ ft, they will converge uniformly 
to this limit in the interval, if, and only if, the integral, depending on x 9 



J sin t

tends uniformly to as n - > -f - oo in a 5^ x fg ft, that is to say if, given 
e > 0, we car assign N = N (e) so that this integral is less than in absolute 
value for every n > N and every x in a rg x fg ft. 

Before we make use of theorem 2 to construct immediate tests of 
convergence for Fourier series, we proceed first to transform and simplify 
this theorem in various ways. For this purpose, we begin by proving the 
following theorems, which apparently lead us rather off the track, but 
also claim considerable interest in themselves. 

Theorem 4. Iff(x) is integrable over ... 2 77, and if (a n ) and (b n ) 

<n 
are its Fourier constants, then 2 (a n 2 -f- b n 2 ) converges.

where each summation is extended from v = 1 to v = n. Since this 
expression is non-negative, we have 



362 Chapter XI. Series ot variable terms. 

Thus the partial sums of the series (of positive terms) in question are 
bounded and the series is convergent, as asserted. 
The above contains in particular 

Theorem 5. The Fourier constants (aj and (6 n ) of an integrable 
function form a null sequence. 

From this, we may deduce quite simply the further 

Theorem 6. // y>(t) is integrable in the interval a<^t^b, then 

b 

A n / tp()cosn tit -+ 0, 



/* = / ty(f) sin nt dt -> 0. 

a 

Proof. If a and b both belong to one and the same interval of 
the form 2 k n <I t <^ 2 (k + 1) n , we define f(t) = y; (f) in a <[ t <L b 
and f(i) = at the remaining points of the first-named interval, for every 
other real t, f(t) is defined so as to be periodic with the period 2n. Then 

b 2t 

A n = f y (t) cos n tdt = / f(t) cos ntdt = na n 
a o 

and similarly B n = n b n , where a n and & M denote the Fourier constants 
of the function f(f). By theorem 5, A n and 5 W therefore 0. If a 
and 6 do not fulfil the above condition, we can split up the interval 
a < t < 6 into a finite number of portions, each of which satisfies the 
condition. A n and B n then appear as the sum of a (fixed) finite number 
of terms, each of which tends to as n *oo. Hence A n and B n do 
the same 45 . 

This important theorem will enable us to simplify the problem of 
the convergence of Dirichlet's integral 46 . 

Supposing 6 chosen arbitrarily with < d < -J , the function 

(/ ., o) |[n

45 This important theorem appears intuitively plausible if we imagine the 
curve y \p (t) cos nt to be drawn for large values of n: We isolate a small interval 
a . . . ft in which y (t) has an almost negligible oscillation (is practically con- 
stant) and proceed to choose n so large that the number of oscillations of 
cosn* is fairly large in the interval; in that case, the arc of the curve 
y = y>(/)cosw/ corresponding to .../? will enclose positive and negative 
areas in approximately equal numbers and of approximately the same size, 
so that the integral is almost 0. 

46 Of course theorem 6 may be proved quite directly, without first proving 
theorem 4. The latter is, however, an equally important theorem in the theory, 
even though, as it happens, we shall not need it again in the sequel.

The Dirichlet integral of theorem 2 a will therefore tend to as

value of d > the new integral 

2^ 

o 

tends to as n increases. Now the latter integral only involves the 
values of f(x Q 2t) in 0^<<5, i. e. of f(x) in# 2 d<^x<*x Q + 2d. 
Since d > may be assumed arbitrarily small, this remarkable result 
contains at the same time the following 

Theorem 7. (Ricinann's theorem. 47 ) The behaviour of the 204. 
Fourier series of f(x) at the point X Q depends only on the values of 
f(x) in the neighbourhood of X Q . This neighbourhood may be as- 
sumed as small as we please 

In order to illustrate this peculiar theorem, we may mention the 
following consequence of it: Consider all possible functions f(x) (inte- 
grable in . . . 2 n) which coincide at a point X Q of the interval . . . 2 n 
and in some neighbourhood of this point, however small, possibly 
varying with the particular function. Then the Fourier series of all 
these functions however much they may differ outside the neigh- 
bourhood in question must, at X Q itself, either all converge or all 
diverge, and in the former case they have the same sum S(X Q ) (which 
may or may not be equal to f(x^)). 

After inserting these remarks, we proceed to re-formulate the 
criterion obtained above, which we may henceforth substitute for 
theorem 2: 

Theorem 8. The necessary and sufficient condition for the Fourier 
series of f(x) to converge at X Q to the sum s(# ), is that for an ar- 
bitrarily chosen positive 6 < -5- , Dirichlet's integral

4 * As regards uniformity of convergence, we can assert nothing straight 
away, since we are ignorant as to whether the integral (c) above considered, 
which tends to as n increases, for every fixed a? , will do so uniformly for 
every 2 of a specified interval on the a;- axis. Actually this is the case, but we 
do not propose to enter into the question further. 



364 Chapter Xf. Series of variable terms. 

There is no difficulty in showing that the denominator sin t in 
the last integrand may be replaced by t. In fact the difference be- 
tween the original integral and the one so obtained, i. e. the integral 
s 





automatically tends to as n increases, by theorem 6, because 
-T-T - is continuous and bounded 49 , and hence intcgrable, in < t^ d. 

Thus we may finally state: 

205* Theorem 9. The necessary and sufficient condition for the Fourier 
series of a function f(x), periodic with the period 2n and integrable over 
Q...271, to converge to S(X Q ) at the point X Q , is that for an arbitrarily 

chosen positive d ( < -g- J , the sequence of the values of the integral 

2 f , . v sin (2 n -f- 1) t ,^ 
- J <p (t ; X ) T- 2 dt 

o 

forms a null sequence. Here <p (i\ x () ) has the same meaning as in 
theorem 2 a. In another form, the condition is that, given e > 0, we 

can assign d < ? and N > 0, so that 50 for every n > N,

^L f ft' \ sin (2 n + 1) t 



C. Conditions of convergence. 

Our preliminary investigations have prospered so far that the 
first two questions of p. 355 may now be attacked directly. By the 
above, these are completely reduced to the following problem: 

Given a function <p(t), integrable in Q<^t<*d, what further 
conditions must this function fulfil in order that the integrals 51 



" In fact. -T : - ~ : -- = -\ ; in the interval, and thus itself 

1 sin/ t /.sin / 1 h-" 

tends to as l-~*0. 

60 The student should make it quite clear to himself that the second for- 
mulation is actually equivalent to the first, although d need only be determined 
after the value of e has been chosen. 

61 For t = 0, we attribute to in the integrand the value A. 



49. Fourier series. C. Conditions of convergence. 365 

should tend to a limit as k increases, and what, in that case, is the 
value of this limit? 52 

Since in this integral, & has a fixed but arbitrarily small value, 
the answer to this question depends only cf. Riemann's theorem 7 
on the behaviour of q>(i) immediately to the right of 0, say in an 
interval of the form < t < <Jj (^ (5). We may accordingly inquire 
also: What properties must cp(f) possess immediately to the right 
of 0, in order that the limit in question may exist? 

A large number of sufficient conditions for this have been found, 
of which we shall only explain two, the great generality of which 
renders them sufficient for most purposes. The first of these was 
established by Dirichlet in the above-named paper (v. p. 356) and was 
the first exact condition of convergence in the theory of Fourier series, 
in winch Dirichlet's work is altogether fundamental. The second is 
due to U. Dini and was discovered in 1880. 

1. Dirichlet' 's rule. // cp (t) is monotone to the right of 0, 206. 
i. e. in an interval of the form < t < d ( ^ <5) then the limit in 

question exists, and we have 

6 

^ lim J h == lirn^ ^ j y w ^

where y> denotes the (right hand) limiting value lim (p(), which cer- 
tainly exists with the assumptions made 53 . 

Proof. 1) In the first place, 
lim 



The existence of this limit, i. e. the convergence of the improper in- 
tegral, follows simply from the fact that, given e > 0, and any two

52 There is no simplification in observing that it would suffice tor k to 
tend to -f oo through odd integral values. 

63 In fact, as <p (t) is integrablo, it is certainly bounded, and by hypothesis 
it is monotone in <C * <C <V Furthermore q? need not =97(0).

The latter integral = -^-dt and therefore remains < K in absol-

Combining the three results of this paragraph, by means of

Thereby the statement is completely established.

the difference (/ ft / k ') tends to 0, by theorem 6, and we may choose

before, with a suitable choice of & > &' we also have

i. e. when d' is suitably chosen, 1 7 fc " | also remains < -q- . Thus, pre- 
cisely as before, we conclude that, for every k > & , 



which proves the validity of Dini's rule. 

We may easily deduce from it the two following conditions. 

3. MpscMtz's rule. // two positive numbers A and a exist,

so that for every positive t < d the former integral remains less than 
a fixed number and in consequence of Dints rule /,, ><p > as required.

Proof. The existence of 



implies the boundedness of this ratio in an interval of the form 
0<^<(5j, i.e. the fulfilment of a Lipschitz- condition with a = l. 
Hence / fc *<?V as asserted. 

The following corollary to these conditions is immediately ob- 
tained 

Corollary. // cp (f) can be split up into the sum of two or more 
functions, each of which satisfies the conditions of one of the four rules 

above, then lim cp (t) = (p again exists, and the Dirichlet integrals J k 

t->+o 
of the function (p(t) tend to <p Q . 

The above rules may at once be transferred to the Fourier series 
of an integrable function f(x), which we assume from the first to be 
given in <^ x < 2 n and to be extended to all other real values of x 
by the equation 



In order thai the Fourier series generated by f (x) should converge 
to a sum s(# ) at the point X Q , the integrals

must, by theorem 9 (&05), form a null sequence, where, as before, 

v (<; *) = \ [/K + 2 + /(* - 2 f)] - s K) . 

This form of the criterion shows, over and above Riemanris theorem 
2O4, that neither the behaviour of f(x) immediately to the right of a? , 
nor that immediately to the left of # , have in themselves any influence 
whatever on the behaviour of the Fourier series of f(x) at X Q . What 
is important is that the behaviour of f(x) to the right of X should 
stand in a certain relation to that on the left of x , namely, such that 
the function

370 Chapter XI. Series ot variable terms. 

should possess the necessary and sufficient properties 57 for the existence 
of the limit of Dirichlet's integrals J k (206) relative to q)(t). 

It is not known what these properties are. The four conditions 
given above for the convergence of Dirichlet's integrals furnish us, 
however, with the same number of sufficient conditions for the con- 
vergence, at a special point X Q , of the Fourier series of a function f(x). 
Each of these conditions requires, in the first instance, that the function 



should tend to a limit <p . A common assumption for all the rules 
which we are about to set up is accordingly the following: The limit 



(8) Km i [f (* + 2*) -/(*,,-- 2 <)] 

- 



must exist. The value of this limit, by theorem 2, will then also be 
the sum of the Fourier scries of f(x) at X Q> if the latter converges. 
This convergence is ensured if the function 



o) = l/(*o + 2 f) + f(* 9 ~ 2 <)] - s (* ), 

considered as a function of t> fulfils one of the four conditions given 
above. At the same time, the value <p Q in those conditions must, by 
theorem 2 a, be 0. We accordingly assume that the two following 
conditions are satisfied: 

207. 1 st assumption. The function f(x) is defined and integrable (hence 
bounded] in the interval ^ x < 2 n and its definition is extended to all 
real values of x by means of the relation 



*1, 2,... 
2 nJ assumption. The limit 

ln[f(x + 2t) + f(x -2()], 

where X Q denotes an arbitrary real number, but is kept fixed throughout, exists 58 , 
and its value is denoted by s (# ), so that the function 

9 (0 = 9 (': *o) = | [/(* + 2 + /(* - 2 I)] - i (*o) 
has a right hand limit lim 9 (f) = 0. 



With these joint assumptions, we have the following four criteria 
for the convergence of the Fourier series off(x) at the point x : 

87 Define e. g. / (x) as entirely arbitrary to the right of x (but integrable in 
an interval of the form x < x < x + 8) and, in x - 8 < x < x 0> let f(x) = 

1 ~ /( 2 *o x) say. The Fourier series off(x) at x is convergent with the sum 2 > 
(Proof, for instance, by means of Dirichlet's rule 208, 1 below.) 
68 The two-sided limit then necessarily also exists. 



49. Fourier series. C. Conditions of convergence. 371 

1. IMrichlct's rule. // <p(t) is monotone in an interval of the 208. 
form < t < <5j, the Fourier series of f(x) converges at X Q and its sum 59 

is equal to S(X Q ). 

2. Dint's rule. // for a fixed (otherwise arbitrary) positive num- 
ber d the integrals 



p 



dt 



remain less than a fixed number for every r such that < T < d, the 
Fourier series of f(x) converges at x and its sum is S(X Q ). 

3. Lipschitz's rule. The same is true, if instead of requiring 
that the integrals should be bounded, we stipulate that two positive 
numbers A and a should exist, such that, for every t such that <t < d, 



4 th rule. The same is true, if instead of the Lipschitz- condition 
we require that <p(t) should possess a right hand differential coeffi- 
cient at 0. 

The application of these rules is made considerably easier by the 
following corollaries: 

Corollary 1. The function f(x) also fulfils the assumptions 1 and 2 
and its Fourier series converges at X Q to the sum s(# ), if f(x) can 
be split up into the sum of two or any fixed number of functions, 
each of which satisfies these two joint assumptions (for a suitable s) 
and in some neighbourhood of x fulfils the conditions of one of 
the above rules. 

Corollary 2. Similarly, it suffices to stipulate in place of assump- 
tion 2 that each of the two (one-sided) limits 

lim f(x + 2 f) = f(x + 0) and lim f(x - 2 1) = f(x - 0) 

t->+0 f-v+0 

should exist, and that the two functions 

^=/t*o + 2 ')-/'(*o + ) and <p, (t) = f(x - 2 t) - f(x Q - 0) 
should each, individually, satisfy the conditions of one of the four rules. 
The Fourier series of f(x) is then convergent at X Q and has the sum 

* (*o) = ![/(*(> + 0) + /X*o -<>)] 

One or two special cases, which, however, are of particular im- 
portance in applications, may be mentioned in the following further 
corollaries: 



69 In case it converges at X QJ the Fourier series of a function f(x) satis- 
fying the assumptions 207 accordingly has the sum /*(#) if, and only if, the 
limit s(a? ), whose existence is stipulated in the second assumption, =f(x ). 
Similarly in the case of the following rules. 



872 Chapter XJ. Series of variable terms. 

Corollary 3. If f(x) satisfies the first assumption and is monotone 
both to the right and to the left of x , the limits mentioned in the 
preceding corollary exist, and the Fourier series of f(x) converges at X Q 

to the sum s(z ) = y [f(x Q + 0) -f- f(x 0)]. Hence, still more 
particularly: 

Corollary 4. The Fourier series of a function f(x) which satisfies the 
first assumption will converge at the point x and its sum will be the 
value f(x) of the function at that point, if f(x) is continuous at X Q and 
monotone on either side of X Q . 

Corollary 5. If f(x) satisfies the first assumption, and the two 
limits f(x Q 0) exist; if, further, both the (one-sided) limits 



Um o-o and 



exist; then the Fourier series of f(x) will converge at X Q and will 
have the sum s (X Q ) = ~ [f(x Q + 0) + f(x - 0)]. 

Corollary 6. The Fourier series of a function f(x) which satisfies the 
first assumption will converge, and will have as its sum the value of the 
function, at any point X Q at which f(x) is differentiate. 



50. Applications of the theory of Fourier series. 

As we see from the rules of convergence developed above, 
extremely general classes of functions are represented by their Fourier 
series. This we propose to illustrate by a number of examples. 

The function f(x) to be expanded must always be given in the 
interval <^ x < 2 n and must possess the period 2 n: f(x 2 n) = f(x). 
The corresponding Fourier series is then, in general, obtained in the 
form 



In particular cases, the sine- or cosine-terms may be absent In fact, 
if f(x) is an even function, 



(the graph of f(x) is symmetrical with respect to the straight lines 
x = k n, (k = 0, 1, 2, . . .), and therefore 

2n n 2n 

n - b n = / f(x) sin n x d x = f + / = ,

as is evident if we replace x by 2 TT x in the second of these two 
partial integrals. The Fourier series of f(x) thus reduces to a pure

cosine-series. If, on the other hand, f(x) is an odd function, 



(the graph of f(x) is symmetrical with respect to the points x = kn, 
k = 0, 1, 2, . . .), and therefore 

271 

n . a n = / f(x) cos n x dx = 0, 
o 

as is equally evident. Thus here the Fourier series of f(x) reduces 
to a pure sine series. 

There are accordingly three different ways in which an arbitrary 
given function F(x), which is defined and integrablc in a <^ x <^ b, 
may be prepared for the generation of a Fourier series. 

l t method. If b a ^> 2 n, a portion of length 2 n is cut out of 
the interval (a, 6), say cc^,x<a-}-2n, and the origin is transferred 
to the point a; we thus obtain a function f(x) defined in <^ x < 2 71: 
It is then defined for the whole #-axis 60 by means of the condition of 
periodicity f (x -^- 2 TT) = /(#). If 6 # < 2 ?r, define /(#) to be con- 
stant = F (b) in b^x<.a+27T and proceed as before 61 . 

2 nd method. Precisely as above, define a function f (x) in 5^ x ^ TT 
(not 2 77) by means of /? (#), put / (#) / (2 77 #) in TT fg # <I 2 TT, and 
then define f(x) for all further #'s by the condition of periodicity. 

3 rd method. Define/(#) as above for < x < TT, put/(0) = /(TT) = 
0, but put f(x)~ /(2 TT ^) in ?r < jc < 2 TT; then again define /(#) 
for all further x's by the condition of periodicity. 

The three functions which aie obtained by these methods from 
a given function F(#), and which are now suitable for the generation 
of a Fourier series, we shall distinguish as f^(x) t f%(x}, f 9 (x)- Whereas 
/*j (#) will certainly give a pure cosine scries and f% (x) a pure sine- 
series, f (x) will lead, as a rule, to a Fourier series of the general 
form (unless, in fact, f (x) is itself already an odd or an even function). 

Since our rules of convergence enable us to recognize the con- 
vergence only at points X Q for which 

lim ~ [f(x + 2t) + f(x - 2 t)] 
^ 



exists, it will be advisable to modify our functions further at the 

60 If b a > 2 TT, a portion of the curve y = F (x) is left out of the repre- 
sentation altogether. If we wish to avoid this, we need only alter the unit of measure- 
ment on the x-axis so that the interval of definition of F (x) has the length 2 TT; 

i. e. we substitute a + - ^ - x for x. 

77 

01 Or else give the interval of definition of F (x) the exact length 2 TT by modi- 
fying the unit of measurement on the *-axis.

whenever this limit exists. (This is certainly the case for / 3 (x), and 
provides the condition / 3 (0) = / 3 (2 k 77) = 0.) If this limit does 
not exist, the functional value f(2kir) does not come into account, 
as with our resources we cannot discover whether the Fourier series con- 
verges there or not. For corresponding reasons we have already put 
/a 00 = ^ above. 

We now go on to concrete examples. 

209. 1. Example. F(x) ss a =f 0. Here 

fi(x] E= /g (a;) EE a, while we have to put 

for x = and x = n> 
a < x < n, 
a n < x < 2 7i. 

Dirichlet's conditions are evidently fulfilled at every point (inclusive of 
the junctions), for each of the three functions. The expansions obtained 
must accordingly converge everywhere and must represent the functions 
themselves. For f^(x] and f%(x), however, they are trivial, as they 

reduce to the constant term a Q = a. For f s (x) f however, we obtain:

The first of these expansions gives for x = the known series for ^; the

With a view to penetrating still further into the significance of these 
results, it is well to sketch the graphs of the function / (x) and a few of 
the corresponding curves of approximation. This we must leave to the 
reader, and we shall only draw attention to the following phenomenon: 

The convergence of the series 210 c is uniform for all #'s; not so 
that of the scries 210 a and b, since their sums are discontinuous, the 



63 A fifth proof, quite different again, is as follows: The expansion 123 is 
uniformly convergent in f x 5 1, by the stipulations made in 123, together 
with 199, 2. Putting x sin t t we see that the expansion 



is uniformly convergent in ^- t f* ^ and may therefore be integrated term-by- 
term over that interval. Now 



this is shewn by a recurrence process, or by writing cos t = z and using Example 
117 b. Hence at once 

7r a = 1 _ 

"8 w== o(2w~+ l) a * 

This method was essentially given by Euler. (Cf. the note referred to in the foot- 
note 38 to 156.)

first at 0, the second at TT. In the former case, the approximation curves 
lie close to the zigzag line representing the limiting curve along the 
whole of its length, whilst in (a) and (b) the corresponding state of affairs 
does not and cannot occur (cf. 216, 4). 

3. Example. F (x) = cos a x (a arbitrary 64 , but 4= 0, 1, 2, . . .). 
a) We first form the function / 2 (x), and accordingly define 
f cos ax in 0^#lS7r 
| cos a (2 TT x) in TT ^ x < 2 TT; 

thus / 2 (#) is a function continuous everywhere, which by Dirichlefs rule 
will also generate a Fourier series continuous everywhere, which represents 
the function, and is necessarily a pure cosine-series. Here we have 

n JT 

TT a n 2 J cos a x cos w jc c/ x J [cos (a + w) ^ + cos (a w) A;] d x\ 



hence, as a was assumed not to be an integer, 

_ f i \ n 2 a sma TT 
7Td n (^ l; g'lT^a 

Therefore the function / 2 (x) in ^ Jt: ^ 2 TT, or in other words the function 
cos OLX in TT ^ ^? ^ + TT, is represented by the series : 



For ^ ^^ TT, we obtain from this the expansion 117, previously deduced 
from entirely different sources: 

cos (X.TT 1 . 2 a . 2 a . 

77 ---- = 7T COt a 7T = - + -= -- r= + -^ - ^, -(- * 
sin a TT a a 2 I 2 ' a 2 2 2 ' 

We thus enter the sphere of the developments of 24. Of course the 
other series expansions there deduced may also be obtained directly from 
our new source. Thus 212 gives for x 

_ TT_ ___!__ 2j* __ , _ 2 a __ 2 a __ __ ^ 

sin a TT ~ a a 2 - 1 2 ~*~ a 2 ~- 2 2 a 2 ~- 3 2 "^ 

Subtracting the cotangent expansion obtained just before, we further obtain 

1 cos arr _ aw _ 4a 4a 4a 

^ ~sirTa ~ ~" w mn ~2" "" "" a 2 ^T 2 "~ a 2 - 3 2 ~ a 2 ~^~5 2 "" " * " 

and so on. 

b) If we now similarly construct an odd function / 3 (#) from F (x) = 
cos a x, we have 

J cos a x in < # < TT, 

/ 3 (#) = J at and at TT, 

[ cos a (2 TT je) in TT < x < 2 TT. 



84 Because otherwise the cosine-expansion would become trivial. 



378 Chapter XI. Series of variable terms. 

Here a may also assume integral values without reducing the result to 
a trivial one. The coefficients b n are obtained from integrals whose value 
is easily worked out, and they lead to the following expansions, valid in

From all the above series, innumerable numerical series may be 
deduced by taking particular values of x and a. 

4. The treatment of F (x) sin a x leads to quite similar expansions. 

5. If the function F (x) = log (2 sin ^ J is arranged for the genera- 
tion of a pure cosine series, we obtain the expansion, valid in < x < TT, 

214. cos x + ^. + ^^ +... = - log (2 sin J) . 

It has, however, to be shewn by a special investigation that the result 
holds in spite of the fact that the function is unbounded in the neigh- 
bourhood of the points and 2 ?r, and therefore is not (properly) intc- 
grable. (Cf. 55, V below, where this will follow quite simply in another 
way.) 

6. Example. F (x) = e yx + ~ ax , a 4= 0, is to be expanded in a 
cosine series. We have therefore to take 

f / \ t F (*) in ^ * ^ *

After working out the extremely easy integrals giving the coefficients a nt 
we obtain

which is valid in - TT 5=1 x ^ + TT. If we substitute e. g. x = TT and write

to the relation, valid for every t 4=

i. e. to an "expansion in partial fractions" of this remarkable function; 
its expansion in power series we can at once deduce from 24, 4, where 

the function -~ - t -JT? was considered, for our function reduces to 
the latter by multiplying by t 2 and adding 1. 

Various remarks. 

The very fact that trigonometrical series are capable of representing extremely 
general types of functions renders the question as to the limits of this capacity 
doubly interesting. As was already remarked, necessary and sufficient conditions 
for a function to be representable by its Fourier series are not known. On the con- 
trary, we find ourselves obliged to consider this as a fundamental property of functions, 
new of its kind, for all attempts to build it up directly by means of the other fun- 
damental properties (continuity, differentiability, mtegrability, etc.) have so far 
failed. We must deny ourselves the satisfaction of supporting this statement in 
all details by working out relevant examples, but we should nevertheless like to 
put forward a few of the facts in this connection. 

1. One of the conjectures which will naturally be made at first sight is that 
all continuous functions are representable by their Fourier series. This is not the 
case, as du Bois-Reymond was the first to show by an example (Gott. Nachr. 1873, 
p. 571) . 




2. On the other hand, to assume the function differentia ble as well as con- 
tinuous is more than is necessary, as is shown by Weierstrass* 66 example of a uni- 
formly convergent trigonometrical series, viz. 

00 / 3 \ 

a n cos(b n irx) (0 < a < 1, b a positive integer, ab > 1 4- n), 
n=l \ ^ / 

which accordingly is the Fourier series of its sum (v. 200, 1 a), but which represents 
a function that is continuous but nowhere differentiable. 



65 We now have simpler examples than that mentioned above. E. g. L. Fejer 
has given a very clear and beautiful example (J. f. d. reine u. angew. Math., Vol. 
137, p. 1. 1909). 

06 Abhandlungen zur Funktionenlehre, Werke, Vol. 2, p. 223. (First published 
1875.) 



380 Chapter XI. Series of variable terms. 

3. Whether continuous functions exist whose Fourier series are everywhere 
divergent is not at present known. 

4. A specially remarkable phenomenon is that known as Gibbs* phenomenon 67 , 
which was first discovered (by J. W. Gibbs) in connection with the series 2 10 a: 
The curves of approximation y =^ s n (x) overshoot the mark, so to speak, in the 
neighbourhood of * = 0. More precisely, let us denote by ( n the abscissa of the 
greatest maximum 6a of y = s n (x) between and IT and let y n be the corresponding 

ordmate. Then n -> ; but -r\ n does not -*- -, as we should expect, but tends to a 

value g equal to (1 17808 . . .). Thus it appears that the limiting configuration to 

which the curves y = s n (x) approximate contains, besides the graph of the function 
210 a (p. 351, fig. 7), a stretch of the >--axis, between the ordinates g, whose 

2 
length exceeds the "jump" of the function by nearly -. In fig. 9, the th approxi- 

mation curve is drawn for n = 9 m the interval . . . ?r, and for n = 44 the initial 
portion is given. 

51. Products with variable terms. 
Given a product of the form 

//a +/.(*)). 

= i 

whose terms are functions of x, we shall define (in complete analogy with 
the theory of series) as an interval of convergence of the product, an interval 
/ at every point of which all the functions f n (x) are defined and the product 
itself is convergent. 

Thus e. g. the products 



/(: - 5). //(- + ). //(' + <- *).(. 



are convergent for every real x t and the same is true of any product of the form 
77(1 + a n x), if 2 } a n is either absolutely convergent (v. 127, theorem 7) or a con- 
ditionally convergent series for which 27 a n 2 converges absolutely (127, theorem 9). 

For every x in f> the product then has a specific value and therefore 
defines a determinate function F(x) in /. We again say: the product 
represents the function F (x) in /, or: F (x) is expanded in the given product 
in /. The main question is as before: how far do the fundamental pro- 
perties (of continuity, differentiability, etc.) belonging to the terms f n (x) 
still hold for the function F (x) represented by the product? Here again the

answer will be that this is the ease in the widest measure, as long as the 
products considered are uniformly convergent. 

What the definition of uniform convergence of a product is to be 
is almost obvious if we refer to the corresponding definition for series, 
since in either case we are essentially concerned with sequences of functions 
(cf. 190, 4). However, we shall set down the definition corresponding 
to the 4 th form (191, 4) for series: 

Definition . The product II (1 +/(*)) is said to be uniformly 17 
convergent in an interval /, //, given e > 0, a single number N = N (z) 
depending only on e, not on x, can be chosen so that 



for every n ~> N, every k > 1 and every x in /. 

It is not difficult to show that with this definition as basis the theorems 
of 47 hold substantially for infinite products 71 . We will, however, leave 
the details to the student, while we prove a few theorems which are less 
far-reaching, but which will amply suffice for all our applications, and 
which have the advantage of providing us at the same time with criteria 
for the uniformity of the convergence of a product. We first have 

Theorem 1. The product //(I + f n (x)) converges uniformly in /218. 
and represents a continuous function in that interval, if the functions f n (x) 
are all continuous in / and the series 2 \ f n (x) \ converges uniformly in /. 

Proof. If 2 1 f n (x) | converges in /, so does the product // ( 1 (- /(#)), 
by 127, theorem 7; indeed, it converges absolutely. Let F (x) denote the 
function it represents. Let us choose m so large that 

l/m+l (*) I + I/H 2 (*) I + + Ifm+K (*) | < 1 

for every x in J and every k^l; this is possible, by hypothesis. 
Consider the product 

// (!+/(*)), 

n=m+l 

69 The symbol o in this section again holds only with the same restrictions as 
in 4648; cf. p. 327, footnote 1. 

70 This definition includes that of convergence. If the latter be assumed, 
we may speak of the "remainder" r n (x) (1 +/ n+ i (#))(! H f n +* 0*0) and 
define uniform convergence as follows: //(I +/ n (x)) is said to converge uniformly 
in/, if for every (x n ) in/, however chosen, r n (x) -> 1. 

Writing //(I +/(*)) = P m (x) and 77 (1 +/(*)) = F w (*), we may 

i/=l i> = rofl 

quite easily deduce e. g. the continuity of F (x) at x from that of the functions 
f v (x) there, by means of the relation 

F (x) - F (*) - P m (*) F m (*) - P m (*) F m (*) 

= [P m (x) - P m (*)] F m (x) + [F m (*) - F m (*)] P m (*). 
13 (051) 



382 Chapter XI. Series of variable terms. 

and denote its partial products by p n (x), n > m. Let F m (x) be the function 
represented by this product. We have (cf. 190, 4) 

Fm, ~ Pm+l + (Pm+2 ~~ Pm-\ l) + + (Pn Pn-l) + 

= Pm+l + Pm\ 1 */w+2 + Pmj 2 */w+3 + + Pn-l '/ + 

i. e. F m (x) is also expressible by an infinite series as is indeed evident 
from 30. Now (by 192, theorem 3) this series converges uniformly in J. 
In fact, for every n > m, we have 



and !/(*) I 

n*=M-\-l 

is uniformly convergent in /, by hypothesis. Accordingly the sequence 
of its partial sums, i. e. the sequence of functions p n (x), tends uniformly 

CO 

to F m in/, so that the product // (1 +/ n (x)) is seen to converge uniformly 

n -m+l 

in /, and this property is not affected when we prefix the first m factors. 
By 193, F m (x) is necessarily continuous in /, since the terms of the 
series which represents it are all continuous in that interval. The same 
is then true of the function 

F (x) = (1 + /i (*)) . . . (1 + f m (*)) F m (x), q. e. d. 

A similar proof holds for 

Theorem 2. // the functions f n (x) are all differentiable in J and 
if not only 2\f n (x) |, but \f n ' (x) \ converges uniformly in /, then F (x) 
is also differentiable in /. Moreover its differential coefficient at every point 
of J where F (x) 4= is given by 72 



Proof. The proof may be put in a form analogous to that of the 
previous theorem; however, in order to make other methods of attack 
familiar, we will conduct the proof by means of the logarithmic function, 
as follows. Let us choose m so large that 



72 If g (x) is difTerentiable at a special point x and g (x) 4= there, the ratio 
8 - - is called the logarithmic differential coefficient ofg (x), because it is , log | g (x) |. 
For (x) = gi (x) - a (x) . gk (x), we have, as is well known, 

SLM _ Si' W , */(*> , , *(*> 

g(x) g, (x) "*" g,(x) "*--*- & ffi ' 

provided that the functions A (x) are all differentiable at the point x in question.

for every x in /, so that, in particular, for every n > m,

By 127, theorem 8, the series

is indeed also uniformly (and absolutely) convergent in J. For since 
l/n (*) I < \ for ever y n > m y | 1 + f n (x) | > \ and therefore

n=m + l 

i. e.

Since finally 



and the last factor on the right has been seen to be differentiate in J 9 
F (x) itself is different! able in /. If, further, F (x) 4= 0, the last relation 
leads at once to the required result, by the rule of differentiation men- 
tioned in the preceding footnote.

two functions F (x) and G (x) have their logarithmic derivatives equal in an interval,

last relation by x and let x -> 0. The left hand side then -> ?r, while the right hand

Chapter XII. 

Series of complex terms. 

52. Complex numbers and sequences. 

After we have discussed in detail, as in Chapter I, the modes of 
formation of all the concepts essential for building up the system of 
real numbers, no new difficulties are raised by the introduction of further 
types of numbers Since the (ordinary) complex numbers and their 
algebra are known to the reader, we may accordingly be content 
with briefly mentioning one or two main points here. 

1- I* was sho wn m 4 that the system of real numbers is in- 
capable of any further extension, and is, moreover, the only system 
of symbols satisfying the conditions which we laid down for a number 
system. Yet the system of complex numbers is a system of bymbols 
to which the name of number system is applied. This apparent contra- 



52. Complex numbers and sequences. 389 

diction is easily removed. For our definition of the number concept 
was in a certain sense an arbitrary one, as we emphasized on p. 12, 
footnote 16: A series of properties which appealed to us essential in the 
case of rational numbers was raised to the rank of characteristic pro- 
perties of numbers in general, and the result justified our doing this, 
in so far as we were able actually to construct a system in all essen- 
tials, a single one, which possessed all these properties. 

If we desire to attribute to other systems the character of a system 
of numbers, we must therefore of necessity diminish the list of char- 
acteristic properties which we set up in 4, 1 4. The question arises 
which of these properties may be dispensed with first of all; i. e. which 
of them may be missing from a system of symbols without its becoming 
impossible to legard the latter as a number system. 

2 Among the properties 4 of a system of symbols, the first with 
which we may dispense, without fear of the system losing the character 
of a number system entirely, are the laws of order and monotony. 
These are based, by 4, 1, on the fact that of two different numbers 
of the system, the one can always be called less than the other, and 
the latter greater than the former. If we drop this distinction and in 
4 replace both the symbols < and ;> by 4=> ^ appears that the 
modified conditions 4 are satisfied by another more general system 
of symbols, namely the system of ordinary complex numbers, but thai 
no other system substantially different from the latter can satisfy them 

3. Accordingly, the system of (ordinary) complex numbers is a 
system of symbols which, as is known, may be assumed to be of the 
form x + yi, where x and y are real numbers, and i is a symbol whose 
manipulation is regulated by the single condition t 9 = 1, for 
which the fundamental laws of arithmetic 2 remain valid without ex- 
ception, provided the symbols < and > are suitably replaced throughout 
by =4=. In short: Except for the last-named restriction, we may work 
formally with complex numbers exactly as with real numbers. 

4. In a known manner (cf. p. 8), complex numbers may be 
brought into (1,1) correspondence with the points of a plane and may 
thus be represented by these: with the complex number x --J- yi we 
associate the point (x, y) of an ay-plane. Every calculation may then 
be interpreted geometrically. Instead of representing the number x-\-yi 
by the point (x, y), it is often more convenient to represent it by a 
directed line (vector) coincident in magnitude and direction with the 
line from (0, 0) to (x, y). 

5. Complex numbers will be denoted in the sequel by a single 
letter: z, f, a, b, . . .; and unless the contrary is expressly mentioned 
or follows without ambiguity from the context, such letters will in- 
variably denote complex numbers. 



390 Chapter XII. Series of complex terms. 

6. By the absolute value (or modulus) | z \ of the complex numbei 
x+yi, is meant the non-negative real value I/a; 9 + y 2 '* by * ts amplitude 
(am z, z=^tf), we mean the angle <p for which both cos(p = ~. p and 

sin cp = -py . When we calculate with absolute values, the rules 3, II, 



1 4 hold unchanged, while 5. loses all meaning. 

Since we may accordingly operate, broadly speaking, in precisely 
the same ways with complex as with real numbers, by far the greater 
part of our previous investigations may be carried out in an entirely 
analogous manner in the realm of complex numbers, or transferred 
to the latter, as the case may be. The only considerations which will 
have to be omitted or suitably modified are those in which the numbers 
themselves (not merely their absolute values) are connected by the 
symbol < or >. 

In order to avoid repetitions, which this parallel course would 
otherwise involve, we have prefixed the sign to all definitions and 
theorems, from Chapter II onwards, which remain valid word for word 
when arbitrary real numbers are replaced by complex numbers, (this 
validity extending equally to the proofs, with a few small alterations 
which will be explained immediately). We need only glance rapidly over 
the whole of our preceding developments and indicate at each place 
what modification is required when we transfer them to the realm of 
complex numbers. A few words will also be said on the subject of 
the somewhat different geometrical representation. 

Definition 23 remains unaltered A sequence of numbers will now 
be represented by a sequence of points (each counted once or more 
than once) in the plane. If it is bounded (24, 1), none of its points 
lie outside a ciicle of (suitably chosen) radius K with origin at 0. 

Definition 25, that of a null sequence, and the theorems 26, 
27, and 28 relating to such null sequences remain entirely unaltered. 

The sequences (z n ) with 

i (_;)n 

- 



are examples of null sequences whose terms are not all real. The student 
should form an exact idea of the position of the corresponding sets of points 
and prove that the sequences are actually null sequences. 

The definitions in 7 of roots, of powers in the general sense, and 
of logarithms were essentially based on the laws of order for real 
numbers. They cannot, therefore, be transferred to the realm of 
complex numbers in that form (cf. 55 below). 

The fundamental notions of the convergence and divergence of 
a sequence of numbers (39 and 40, l) still remain unaltered, 



52. Complex numbers and sequences. 



391 



although the representation of z n -> now becomes the following l : If 
a circle of arbitrary (positive) radius e is described about the point as 
centre, we can always assign a (positive) number n Q such that all terms 
of the sequence (z n ) with index n > n Q lie within the given circle. The 
remark 39, 6 (1 st half) therefore holds word for word, provided we in- 
terpret the ^-neighbourhood of a complex number as being the circle mentioned 
above. 

In setting up the definitions 40, 2, 3, the symbols < and > 
played an essential part; they cannot, therefore, be retained unaltered. 
And although it would not be difficult to transfer their main content 
to the complex realm, we will drop them entirely, and accordingly 
in the complex realm we shall call every non-convergent sequence 
divergent ' 3 . 

Theorems 41, 1 to 12, and the important group of theorems 43, 
with the exception of theorem 3, remain word for word the same, 
together with all the proofs. 

The most important of these theorems were the Cauchy-Toeplitz 
limit-theorems 43, 4 and 5, and since we have in the meantime gained 
complete familiarity with infinite series, we shall formulate them once 
more in this place, with the extension indicated in 44, 10, and for 
complex numbers.

1 For complex numbers and sequences, we preferably use in the sequel 
the letters *,(,,.... 

2 We might say, in the case | * | -> + OO , that (z n ) is definitely 
divergent with the limit CO, or tends or diverges (or even converges) to oo. 
That would be quite a consistent definition, such as is indeed constantly made 
in the theory of functions. However, it evidently involves a small inconsist- 
ency relative to the use of the terms in the real domain, that e. g. the sequence 
of numbers ( l) n n should be called definitely or indefinitely convergent, 
according as it is considered in the complex or in the real domain. And even 
though, with a little attention, this may not give us any trouble, we prefer 
to avoid the definition here.

(For applications of this theorem, see more especially 233, as well 
as 60, 62 and 63.) 

Unfortunately, we lose the first of the two main criteria of 9, 
which was the more useful of the two. Moreover, the proof of the 
second main criterion cannot be transferred to the case of complex 
numbers, as it makes use of theorems of order throughout. In spite 
of this, we shall at once see that the second main criterion itself 
in all its forms remains valid for complex numbers. The proof 
may be conducted in two different ways: either we reduce the new 
(complex) theorem to the old (real) one, or we construct fresh founda- 
tions for the proof of the new theorem, by extending the develop- 
ments of 10 to complex numbers. Both ways are equally simple 
and may be indicated briefly: 

1. The reduction of complex sequences to real sequences is most 
easily accomplished by splitting up the terms into their real and 
imaginary parts. If we write z n = x n -\- iy n and f = f -(- irj, we have 
the following theorem, which completely reduces the question of the 
convergence or divergence of complex sequences to the corresponding 
real problem: 

322. Theorem 1. The sequence (z n ) s= (x n + iy n ) converges to = -f- i v\ 
if, and only if, the real parts x n converge to and the imaginary parts 
y n converge to rj. 



3 In consequence of (b), A k = Za kn is absolutely convergent and there- 

n 

fore, as the z n 's are bounded, by 41, Theorem 2, the series ^ai c n z n =i!s k 1S a l 80 
absolutely convergent. n 



52. Complex numbers and sequences. 393 

Proof, a) If # n -*f and y n +rj, (x n f) and (y n - 77) are null 
sequences. By 26,1, the same is true of i(y n rj) and, by 28,1, of 

( x n -") + i(y n ~~ y}> l - e - f ( z n ) 

b) If z n **, |2 OT I is a null sequence; since 4 

(x n f) and (y n rf) are also null sequences, by 26, 2, i. e. we have 
both 

The theorem is established. 

The theorem at which we are aiming follows immediately: 

Theorem 2. For the convergence of a complex sequence (z w ), the 
conditions of the second main criterion 47 are again necessary and 
sufficient, namely, that, for every choice of e > 0, we should be able 
to assign n so that 

for every n >> n Q and every n' > n Q . 

Proof, a) If (2 n ) converges, so do (x n ) and (y w ) by the preceding 
theorem As these are real sequences, we may apply 47, and, 
given e > 0, we may choose n l and n 3 so that 

I x n' x n I < o f r ever y n > n i an d every n' > n t , 
and 

I ^ y n | < TT for every n > w 9 and every n' > n^ 

Taking n Q greater than n x and n 2 , we have accordingly, for every n > n Q 
and every w' > n , 



The conditions of our theorem are therefore necessary. 

b) If, conversely, (z n ) fulfils the conditions of the theorem, 
i. e. given e > 0, we can determine n so that | z n ' z n \< e, provided 
only that n and n' are both > n , we have also, for the same n 
and n' (by our last footnote) 

*n'-*< e and - <' 



* We have in general 
since 



394 Chapter XII. Series of complex terms. 

By 47, this implies that (x n ] and (yj are convergent, so that (z n ) must 
also converge, by the preceding theorem; the conditions of our theorem 
are therefore also sufficient. 

2. Direct treatment of complex sequences. In the treatment of real 
sequences, nests of intervals constituted our most frequent resource. 
In the complex domain, nests of squares will render us the same 
services: 

223. Definition. Let Q , Q lf @ 3 , ... denote squares, whose sides will 
for simplicity be assumed parallel to the coordinate-axes. If each square 
is entirely contained in the preceding and if the lengths I 0> l lt ... of 
the sides form a null sequence, we shall say that the squares form 
a nest. 

For nests of squares, we have the 

Theorem. There exists one and only one point belonging to all the 
squares of a given nest of squares. (Principle of the innermost 
Point.) 

Proof. Let the left hand bottom corner of Q n be denoted by 
n + ta anc * me right hand upper corner by b n -}-ib*. A point 
z = x -f- i y belongs to the square Q n if, and only if 5 , 



Now, in consequence of our hypotheses, the intervals J n = a n . . . b n on 
the a;- axis, and similarly the intervals /n = n*...&n* on the y-axis, 
form a nest of intervals. There is therefore exactly one point f on 
the #-axis and exactly one point iv\ on the y-axis belonging to all the 
intervals of the corresponding nest. But this means that there is also 
exactly one point f = f + 117, belonging to all the squares Q n . 

We are now in a position to transfer definition 52 and theorem 54 
to the complex domain: 

224. Definition. // (z n ) is an arbitrary sequence, is said to be a 
limiting point or point of accumulation of the sequence if, given an 
arbitrary 6 > 0, the relation 

k-l< 

is satisfied for an infinity of values of n (in particular, for at least 
one n > any given n Q ). 

225. Theorem. Every bounded sequence possesses at least one limiting 
point. (Bolzano- Weierstrass Theorem.) 

Proof. Suppose \z n \ < K and draw the square Q Q whose sides 
lie on the parallels to the axes through & an d *% AH them's 

5 This statement at the same time expresses, in pure arithmetical lang- 
uage, the relations of magnitude framed in geometrical form in the theorem 
and definition 228. 



52. Complex numbers and sequences. 395 

are contained in it, i. e. certainly an infinity of z n 's. (> is divided by 
the cooi dinate axes into four equal squares One at least of the four 
must contain an infinity of z n 's. (In fcict, if there were only a 
finite number in each, there would also be only a finite number 
in @ , which is not the case) Let Q denote the first quarter' 1 
which has this property. This we again proceed to divide into four equal 
squares, denoting by @ 3 the first quarter which contains an infinity of 
points z n , and so on. The sequence Q , Q , Q 2 , ... forms a nest of 
squares, since each Q n lies within the preceding and the lengths of the 

sides form a null sequence, namely (2K-^-J. Let f denote the 

innermost point of this nest 7 ; f is a point of accumulation of (z n ). 
For if e is given > and m is chosen so that the side of Q m is less 

than -|-, the whole of the square Q m lies within the 6- neighbourhood 

of , and, with it, an infinite number of points z n also lie in this 
neighbourhood. Therefore f is a point of accumulation of (z n ) 9 and 
the existence of such a point is established. 

The validity of the second main criterion for the complex domain, 
i. e. of the theorem 222, 2, formulated above may now be 
established once more, but without any appeal to the "real" theorems, 
on the same lines as in 47. 



Proof, a) If z n >, i.e. (z n f ) is a null sequence, we can 

-C< and *'-f<- 



determine n Q so that 



provided only that n and n' are simultaneously > n [see part a) of 
the proof of 47]. For these ns and w"s, we therefore also have 



The condition is accordingly necessary. 

b) If, conversely, the e- condition is fulfilled, (z n )is certainly bounded. 
In fact, if m > n Q and n > m, 



\. e. every Z M with n "> m lies in the circle of radius e round z

6 We regard the four quarters as numbered in the order in which the 
four quadrants of the xy -plane are habitually taken. 

7 The process of obtaining this point corresponds exactly to the method 
of successive bisection so often applied in the real domain. 



396 Chapter XII. Series of complex terms! 

By our preceding theorem, it follows that (zj tas at least one 
limiting point . Supposing there exists a second limiting poi&J

which is positive. By 224, the definition of limiting point, we can 
choose n Q as large as we please and yet have an n > n for which 
| z n | < e and also an ri > n for which | z n > f ' | < Thus 
above any number w , however large, there exist a pair of indices n 
and w' for which 8 

Iv -*! > 

This contradicts our hypothesis. Accordingly f must be the unique 
limiting point, and outside the circle of radius e round f there is 
only a finite number of points z n . If n is suitably chosen, we there- 
fore have \z n |<e for every n > n , and consequently z n *. 
The condition of the theorem is therefore sufficient also 9 . 



53. Series of complex terms. 

As a series 2 a n of complex terms must obviously be interpreted 
as the sequence of its partial sums, the basis for the extension of 
our theory of infinite series has already been provided by the above. 

Corresponding to 222, 1, we have first the 

226. Theorem. A series 2 a n of complex terms is convergent if, and 
only if, the series 2 9t (a n ) of the real parts of its terms and the series 
2 $ (flj of their imaginary parts converge separately. Further > if these 
two series have the sums s' and s" respectively, the sum of 2 a n is 
s = s' + ; 5 ". 

In accordance with 222, 2 the second principal criterion (81) for 
the convergence of infinite series remains unaltered in all its forms, 
and, at the same time, the theorems 83 deduced from it, on the algebra 
of convergent series, also retain their full validity. 

Since, in the same way, theorem 85 also remains unchanged, 
we shall, as before, distinguish between absolute and non-absolute con 
vergence of series of complex terms (Def. 86). 



hence 



9 Hence we may also say: (z n ) converges if, and only if, it is bounded 
and possesses only one point of accumulation. This is then at the same time 
the limit of the sequence. 



53. Series of complex terms. 397 

Here again we have the 

Theorem. The series 2 a n of complex terms is absolutely con- 227, 



vergent if, and only if, both the series 2^i(a n ) and 2%(a n ) are ab- 
solutely convergent. 

The proof results simply from the fact that every complex number 
z = x-\-iy satisfies the inequalities (cf. p. 393, footnote 4) 



In consequence of this simple theorem, it is at once clear that, 
with series of complex terms as with real series, the order of the terms 
is immaterial if the series converges absolutely (Theorem 88,1). 

If, however, 2a n is not absolutely convergent, either 2$l(a n ) or 
^3(0 must be conditionally convergent. By a suitable rearrangement 
of the terms, the convergence of the series 2a n may therefore be des- 
troyed in any case, as in the proof of theorem 89, 2, that is: In the 
case of series of complex terms also, the convergence, when it is not 
absolute, depends essentially on the order of succession of the terms. 
(Regarding the extension to series of complex terms of Riemanns 
rearrangement theorem 44, cf. the remarks on the following page.) 

The next theorems, 89, 3 and 4, as also the main rearrangement 
theorem 90, which relate to absolutely convergent series, still remain 
valid, without modification or addition, for series of complex terms. 

Since the determination of the absolute convergence of a series 
is a question relating to series of positive terms, the whole theory of 
series of positive terms is again enlisted for the study of series of 
complex terms: Everything that was proved for absolutely convergent 
series of real terms may be utilized for absolutely convergent series 
of complex terms 

If we omit power series from consideration for the present, we 
observe, on looking over the later sections of Part II ( 18 27), that 
the developments of Chapter X are the first for which there is any 
question of transference to series of complex terms. 

Abel's partial summation 182, being of a purely formal nature, 
and its corollary 183, of course hold also for complex numbers, and 
so does the convergence- test 184 which was based directly on them. 
The special forms of this test may also all be retained, provided we 
keep to the convention agreed on in 220, 5, in accordance with which 
all sequences assumed to be monotone are real. In the case of du Bois- 
Reymond's and Dedekind's tests, even this precaution becomes unnecessary: 
they hold word for word and without any restriction for arbitrary series 
of the form 2 a n b n , with complex a n and b n . 

Riemanris rearrangement theorem ( 44) is, on the contrary, essen-

tially a "real" theorem. In fact, if a series 2a n of complex terms is 
not absolutely convergent, so is one at least of the two series JJjR^iJ 
and 2%(a n ), by 227. By a suitable rearrangement, we can therefore, 
in accordance with Riemanns theorem, produce in one of these two 
series a prescribed type of convergence or divergence. But the other 
one of the two series will be rearranged in precisely the same manner, 
and there is no immediate means of foreseeing what the effect of the 
rearrangement on this series or on 2a n itself will be. It has recently 
been shown, however, that if 2a n is not absolutely convergent, it may 
be transformed by a suitable rearrangement into a series, again con- 
vergent, whose sum may be prescribed to have either any value in 
the whole complex plane or any value on a particular straight line in 
this plane, according to the circumstances of the case 10 . 

The theorems 188 and 189 of Mertens and Abel on multi- 
plication of series ( 45) again remain valid word for word, together 
with the proofs. For the second of these theorems we must, it is true, 
rely on the second proof (Cesaro's) alone, as we have provisionally 
skipped the consideration of power series (cf. later 232). 

At this point we are in possession of the whole machinery 
required for the mastery of series of complex terms and we can at 
once proceed to the most important of its applications. 

Before doing so, however, we shall first deduce the following 
extremely far-reaching criterion. 

00 

228. Weierstrass* criterion u . A series 2 a n of complex terms, for which 



with A n bounded, where <x is complex and arbitrary, and 12 A>1, 



10 We thus have the following very elegant theorem, which in a certain sense 
completes the solution of the rearrangement problem: The "range of summation" 
of a series Z a n of complex terms i. e. the set of values which may be obtained 
as sums of convergent rearrangements of Ea n is either a definite point, or a 
definite straight line, or the entire plane. Other cases cannot occur. A proof is 
given by P. L&vy (Nouv. Annales (4), Vol. 5, p. 506, 1905), but an unexception- 
able statement of the proof is not found earlier than in E. Steinits (Bedmgt kon- 
vergente Reihen und konvexe Systeme, J. f. d. reine u. angew. Math., Vol. 143, 
1913; Vol. 144, 1914; Vol. 146, 1915). 

For the (more restricted) result that every conditionally convergent series 
Sa n ** s can be rearranged to give another convergent series Sa n f =* s' with s' =t= s 9 
W. Threlfall has given a fairly short proof (Bedingt konvergente Reihen, Math. 
Zschr., Vol. 24, p. 212, 1926).

12 An equality of this kind may of course always be assumed ; we need only 

write A n = H* ( 1 " ' ) as a definition. What is essential in the condition 

\ n a n / 

is here, as previously (cf. footnote to 166), that when a and A are suitably chosen 
the An* should be bounded. It is substantially the same thing to assume that

series is invariably divergent. If 0<8fl(a)<^l, both the series

Proof. 1. Let cc = (t-\-iy and let us first assume /?== $

for sufficiently large values of n, it follows from Gauss's test 172 that 
2\a n \ is divergent.

13 As regards the series 2 a n itself, it was shown by Weierstrass, I.e., that this is 
also divergent whenever Ot (a) fS 1. The proof is somewhat troublesome. A 
further more exact investigation of the series 27 a n itself in the case 5^ 0? (a) fg 1 
is given by A. Pringsheim (Archiv d. Math, und Phys. (3), Vol. 4, pp. 1 19, in

Hence | a n \ > C m -\ a m \ , for every n>m, and w cannot tend to 0, 
so that 2a n again diverges (cf. 17O, 1).

moreover, all its terms positive for sufficiently large n's. Now

since the fraction on the right hand side tends to the positive limit ~~ 
when n *-f-c that on the left is, for every sufficiently large n, less

ever, that

is a sub series of 2(a n n+1 ) and therefore converges absolutely, 
by a); also, since | a n \ + | n + 1 1 *0 with a n , we may omit the 
brackets, by 83, supplement to theorem 2. This proves the con- 
vergence of 2 ( l) n a n . 

This theorem enables us to deduce easily the following further 
theorem, which will be of use to us shortly:

the series 2a n z n is absolutely convergent for \z\ < 1, divergent for every

a) converge absolutely, if *3i () > 1 ,

single point z = + 1 

c) diverge, if 9R (a) ^ .

the statements relative to \z\^\ are immediately verified. For

case | a n \ remains greater than a certain positive number for every 
sufficiently large n. 

Finally, if < 5R(a) ^ 1 and z 4* -f- 1, the convergence of 2a n z n 
follows from Dedekind's test 184, 3. For we proved in the preceding 
theorem that 2\a n a n ^. 1 \ converges and a n >0; that the partial 
sums of 2z n are bounded, for every (fixed) 24>-|-l on the circum- 
ference | z | = 1 , follows simply from the fact that for every n

54. Power series. Analytic functions. 

The term "power series" is again used here to denote a series 
of the form 2a n z n , or, more generally, of the form 2a n (z z^ n 9 
where now both the coefficients a n and the quantities z and Z Q may 
be complex. 

The theory of these series developed in 18 to 21 remains vab'd 
without any essential modification. In transferring the considerations of 
those sections, we may therefore be quite brief. 

Since the theorems 98, 1 and 2 remain entirely unaltered in the 
new domain, the same is true of the fundamental theorem 93 itself, 
on the behaviour of power series in the real domain. Only the geo- 
metrical interpretation is somewhat different: The power scries 2a n z* 



14 If we take into account Pnngsheim's result mentioned in the preceding* 
footnote, we may state here, more definitely except for * = -fl. 



40 2 Chapter XII. Series of complex terms. 

converges indeed absolutely for every z interior to the circle of 
radius r round the origin 0, while it diverges for all points outside 
that circle. This circle is called the circle of convergence of the power 
series and the name radius applied to the number r thus becomes, 
for the first time, completely intelligible. Its magnitude is given as before 
by the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem 94. 

Regarding convergence on the circumference of the circle of con- 
vergence, we can no more give a general verdict than we could re- 
garding the behaviour at the endpoints of the interval of convergence 
in the case of real power series. (The examples which follow immedia- 
tely will show that this behaviour may be of the most diverse nature.) 

The remaining theorems of 18 also retain their validity unaltered. 

230. Examples. 

1. 2z n ] r=l. In the interior of the unit circle, the series is convergent, 
with the sum . On the boundary, i. e. for | z \ = 1 , it is everywhere di- 

L Z

8. 5] ; r=l. The series is certainly not convergent for all the 
ft 

boundary points, for* = l gives the divergent series . However, it is also 

not divergent for all these points, since z = 1 gives a convergent series. In 
fact, theorem 229 of the preceding section shows, more precisely, that the 
series must converge conditionally at all points of the circumference |jr| = l 
different from + 1 ; for we have here 



The same result may also be deduced directly from Dinchlefs test 184, 2, since 
Z z n has bounded partial sums for z =f= -f 1 and | s | = 1 (cf. the last formula of 






the preceding section) and tends monotonely to 0. As

the convergence can, however, only be conditional 16 . 

4. 5? -. ; r = 1 . This series diverges at the four boundary points 
4 n 

and t, and converges conditionally at every other point of the boundary. 



16 If 2a n z n has real coefficients (as in most of the subsequent examples) 
this power series of course has the same radius as the real power series 2a n x n . 

16 These facts regarding convergence may also be deduced from 185, 5, 
by splitting up the series into its real and imaginary parts. Conversely, how- 
ever, the above mode of reasoning provides a new proof of the convergence 
of these two real series. 



54. Power series. Analytic functions. 403

5. For , r = -f-OO. For 2'n!* n , r=0; thus this series converges 

nowhere but at z=0. 



6. The series J (-!)-. and ^(_l)*-^__ are everywhere 

convergent. 

7. A power series of the general form 2a n (z z ) n converges absolutely 
at all interior points of the circle of radius r round z ot and diverges outside 
this circle, where r denotes the radius of 2a n z n . 

Before proceeding to examine the properties of power series in 
more detail, we may insert one or two remarks on 



Functions of a complex variable. 

If to every point z within a circle $ (or more generally, a 
domain 17 ) a value w is made to correspond in any particular manner, 
we say that a junction w = f(z) of the complex variable z is given in 
this circle (or domain). The correspondence may be brought about in 
a great number of ways (cf. the corresponding remark on the concept 
of a real function, 19, Def. l) ; in all that follows, however, the func- 
tional value will almost always be capable of expression by an explicit 
formula in terms of z, or else will be the sum of a convergent series 
whose terms are explicitly given. Numerous examples will occur very 
shortly; for the moment we may think of the value w, for instance, 
which at each point z within the circle of convergence of a given 
power series represents the sum of the series at that point. 

The concepts of the limit, the continuity, and the differentiability of a 
function are those which chiefly interest us in this connection, and their 
definitions, in substance, follow precisely the same lines as in the real 
domain : 

1. Definition of limit. If the function w=f(z) is defined 18 for 231. 
every z in a neighbourhood of the fixed point , we say that 

iim f(z] = co 



or 

_ f(z)-+a> for *-*, 

17 A strict definition of the word "domain" is not needed here. In the 
sequel, we shall always be concerned with the interior of plane areas bounded 
by a finite number of straight lines or arcs of circles, in particular with circles 
and half-planes 

18 f(z) need not be defined at the point itself, but only for all z's which 
satisfy the condition 0< |* | <Q. The d of the above definition must then 
of course be assumed 



404 Chapter XII. Series of complex terms. 

if, given an arbitrary e > , we can assign d d (e) > so that 

\f(z)-a>\<e 

for every 2 satisfying the condition < | z \ < 6; or which comes 
to exactly the same thing 19 if for every sequence (z n ) converging 
to , whose terms lie in the given neighbourhood of and do not 
coincide with , the corresponding functional values w n = f(z n ) con- 
verge to co. 

If we consider the values of f (z) , not at all the points of a neigh- 
bourhood of , but only at those which lie, for instance, on a parti- 
cular arc of a curve ending at , or in an angle with its vertex at , 
or, more generally, which belong to a set of points M, for which 
is a point of accumulation, we say that limf(z) = co or f(z)*-co 
as z+> along that arc, or within that angle, or in that set M, if the 
above conditions are fulfilled, at least for all points z of the set M which 
come into consideration in the process. 

2. Definition of continuity. If the function w = f(z) is defined 
in a neighbourhood of and at itself, we say that f(z) is continuous 
at the point , if 

lim f(z) 



exists and is equal to the value of the function at , i. e. if f(z) */"() 
We may also define the continuity of f(z) at when z is restricted to an 
arc of a curve containing the point , or an angle with its vertex at , 
or any other set of points M that contains and of which is a limiting 
point; the definitions are obvious from 1. 

3. Definition of differentiability. If the function w = f(z) is de- 
fined in a neighbourhood of and at itself, f(z) is said to be differ- 
entiate at , if the limit 

lim ' 



exists in accordance with 1. Its value is called the differential coeffi- 
cient of f(z) at and is denoted by /"(). (Here again the mode of 
variation of z may be subjected to restrictions.) 

We must be content with these few definitions concerning the 
general functions of a complex variable. The study of these functions 
in detail constitutes the object of the so-called theory of functions, one 
of the most extensive domains of modern mathematics, into which we 
of course cannot enter further in this place 30 . 



19 Same proof as in the real domain. 

80 A rapid view of the most important fundamental facts of the theory 
of functions may be obtained from two short tracts by the author : Funktionen- 



54. Power series. Analytic functions. 405 

The above explanations are abundantly sufficient to enable us to 
transfer the most important of the developments of 20 and 21 to 
power series with complex terms. 

In fact, those developments remain valid without exception for 
our present case, if we suitably change the words "interval of conver- 
gence' to "circle of convergence" throughout Theorem 5 (99) is the 
only one to which we can form no analogue, since the concept of 
integral has not been introduced for functions of a complex argument. 
All this is so simple that the reader will have no trouble, on looking 
through these two sections again, to interpret them as if they had been 
intended from the first to relate to power series with complex terms. 

At the most, a few remarks may be necessary in connection with 
Abel's limit theorem 100 and theorem 107 on the reversion of 
a power series. In the case of the latter, the convergence of the series 
y + As y' 2 H ---- > an( ^ hence of the series y -f- b^ y 1 -\ ---- , which satis- 
fied the conditions of the theorem, were only proved for real values of y. 
This is clearly sufficient, however, as we have thereby proved that this power 
series has a positive radius of convergence, which is all that is required. 

As regards Abel's limit theorem, we may even corresponding 
to the greater degree of freedom of the variable point z prove more 
than before, and for this reason we will go into the matter once more: 

Let us suppose 2 a n z n to be a given power series, not everywhere 
convergent, but with a positive radius of convergence. We first observe 
that, exactly as before, we may assume this radius = 1 without intro 
ducing any substantial restriction On the circumference of the circle 
of convergence, | z \ = 1, we assume that at least one point z exists 
at which the series continues to converge. Here again we may assume 
that Z Q is the special point + 1. In fact, if z 4 s + 1> we need only put 

"n*0* =*,!> 

the series 2a n ' z n also has the radius 1 and converges at the point -j- 1. 

The proof on^mally given, where everything may now be 
interpreted as "complex", then establishes the 

Theorem. // the power series 2' a n z n has the radius 1 and remains 
convergent at the point -f- 1 of the unit circle, and if 2 a n = s t then 
we also have 



if z approaches the point + 1 along the positive real axis from the 
origin 21 0.

233. We can now easily prove more than this: 

Extension of AbeVs theorem. With the conditions of the preceding 
theorem, the relation 



remains true if the mode of approach of z to +1 is restricted only 
by the condition that z should remain within the unit circle and in 

the angle between two arbi- 
trary (fixed) rays which pene- 
trate into the interior of the 
unit circle , starting from the 
point + 1 (see Fig. 10). 

The proof will be con- 
ducted quite independently of 
previous considerations, so that 
we shall thus obtain a third 




proof of Abel's theorem. 



Let Z Q ,

if, as before, we write 2a n z n = f(z). In Toeplitz theorem 



choose for a ftn the value

which, by hypothesis, converges to s. It follows immediately that

n=0 



also tends to s as k increases. This proves the statement, provided 
we can show that the chosen numbers a kn satisfy the conditions (a), 
(b) and (c) of 221. Now (a) is clearly fulfilled, as * fc 1, and the 

CO 

sum of the & th row is now A k = (l z k ] ^z k = 1, so that (c) is 

n=o 

fulfilled. Finally (b) requires the existence of a constant K such that 



for all points z = z k 



1 in the angle (or any sector-shaped portion 



of it with its vertex at +1). It only remains, therefore, to establish 



54. Power series. Analytic functions. 407 

the existence of such a constant. This reduces (v. Fig. 10) to proving 
the following statement: If z = l Q (cos <p + * s i n 9?) w#A | <P | ^ <P < ^ 

and < Q <I Q Q < 2 cos <p , a constant A = A (<^ , ^ ) exists, depending 
only on <p and Q O , such that 

^^ A

sufficient to assume Q Q = COS<PQ> an d in that case we may at once

show that A = is a constant of the desired kind. In fact, the 

cos<p 

statement then runs: 



1 - yi - 2 Q cos <p + e a cos <Po 
or 

2 Q cos 9? + 2 <I cos 9? + Q* cos 2 <p , 

for < Q<L cos9? and \<p\ <; go Q . By replacing 99 by <p and 2 by 
cos<p on the left hand side, the latter is increased; therefore it cer- 
tainly suffices to show that 

q cos 9 ^ q cos <p + ^ <P cos 2 9 , 

- which is obviously true. This extension of Abel's theorem to "com- 
plex modes of approach" or "approach within an angle" is due to 
O. Stolz 22 . 

This completes the extension to the case of complex numbers of all the 
theorems of 20 and 21 with the single exception of the theorem on inte- 
gration, which we have not defined in the present connection. In particular, 
it is thereby established that a power series in the interior of its circle of 
convergence defines a function of a complex variable, which is continuous 
and different iable the latter "term by term" and as often as we please 
in that domain, and accordingly possesses the two properties which 
above all others are required, in the case of a function, for all purposes 
of practical application. For this reason, and on account of their great 
importance in further developments of the theory, a special name has 
been reserved for functions representable in the neighbourhood of a point 

28 Zeitschrift f. Math. u. Phys., Vol. 20, p. 369, 1875. In recent years the 
question of the converse of Abel's theorem has been the object of numerous investi- 
gations, i. e. the question, under what (minimum of) assumptions relating to 
the coefficients a n , the existence of the limit of J (z) as z > 1 (within the angle) 
entails the convergence of a n . An exhaustive survey of the present state of research 
in this respect is given in papers by G. H . Hardy and J. E. Ltttlewood, Abel's theorem 
and its converse, Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. (2), I. Vol. 18, pp. 205 235, 1920; II. 
Vol. 22, pp. 254269, 1923; III. Vol. 26, pp. 219 23G, 1926. Cf. also theorems

z by a power series E a n (z z Q ) n . They are said to be analytic or regular 
at Z Q . By 99, such a function is then analytic at every other interior point 
of the circle of convergence; it is therefore said simply to be analytic or 
regular in this circle 23 . In particular, a series everywhere convergent re- 
presents a function regular in the whole plane, which is therefore shortly 
called an integral function. 

All the theorems which we have proved about functions expressed 
by power series are theorems about analytic functions. Only the two fol- 
lowing, which are of special importance in the sequel, need be expressly 
formulated again. 

234. 1- If two functions are analytic in one and the same circle , then so are 
(by 21) their sum, their difference, and their product. 

For the quotient the corresponding statement is primarily true (by 
105, 4) only if the function in the denominator is not zero at the centre 
of the circle, and provided, if necessary, that this circle is replaced by a 
smaller one. 

2. If two functions, analytic in one and the same circle, coincide in a 
neighbourhood, however small, of its centre (or indeed at all points of a set 
having this centre as point of accumulation), the two functions are completely 
identical in the circle (Identity theorem for power series 97). 

Besides stating these two theorems, which are new only in form, 
we shall prove the following important theorem, which gives us some 
information on the connection between the moduli of the coefficients of 
a power series and the modulus of the function it represents :

235. Theorem. If f(z) = Z a n (z z Q ) n converges for \ z Z Q \ < r, then 

= o 

\^\^ M P (P = 0, 1, 2, . . .), 

G 

if < < r and M ~ M (Q) is a number which \ f(z) \ never exceeds along 
the circumference \ z Z Q \ = Q. (Cauchy's inequality.) 

Proof 24 . We first choose a complex number 77, of modulus = 1, 
for which however -rf 1 3= 1 for any integral 25 exponent q ^ 0. Now we 
consider the function 
*(*) = (*- *o) k 

28 A function is accordingly said to be "analytic" or "regular" in a circle ,ft 
when it can be represented by a power series which converges in this circle. 

24 The following very elegant proof is due to Weierstrass (Werke II, p. 224) 
and dates as far back as 1841. Cauchy (Me"moire lithogr., Turin 1831) proved the 
formula indirectly by means of his expression for / (z) in the form of an integral. 
The existence of a constant M that | f(z) \ never exceeds on | z z \ 2 is practically 
obvious, of course, since M = 2 \ a n \ Q n clearly has this property. This Mis obviously 
also such that | a n \ Q n ^ M. But the above theorem states that every M that | / (z) \ 
never exceeds has the property that | a n \ Q n is always 5^ M. 

25 Such numbers 17 of course exist, for if t\ cos (a TT) + i sin (a TT), then 
if* cos (q a TT) + i sin (q a TT) ; this is never 1 if a is chosen irrational.

for a specific integral value of the exponent k ^ and an arbitrary 
constant coefficient a. If we denote by g Q , g l9 g >2 , ... the values of 
this function for z = Z Q + Q- rj v , v = 0, 1 , 2, . . . , we have for n ^ 1

hence 

I 

The expression on the right hand side contains only constants, besides 
the denominator n; it therefore follows that the arithmetic mean 

\-gn-l ~ 



as n increases. In the case k 0, we should be concerned with the 
identically constant function g(z) s= a, for which 



since the ratio is equal to a for every n, in this case. If we consider 
the rather more general function

where I and m are fixed integers ^> 0, and now form the arith- 
metic mean

(where, as before, g v = g (z -f- Q rj v ), v = 0, 1, . . .), this clearly + b , 
by the two cases just treated. If, further, it is known that the function g(z)> 
for every z of the circumference | z Z Q \ = Q, is never greater than a 
certain constant K, we have also 

gp-f ffi + " + gn-l ^ n A" ^ 

W ~~ 7J 

and therefore also 



With these preliminary remarks, the proof of the theorem is now 
quite simple: Let p be a specific integer ^0. As 2j\ a n \Q* con 
verges, given e > 0, we can determine q > p so that

and this series converges for [ z z | < 1 1 z \ i. e. for every z 
nearer to z than -f- 1; in other words, the circle of convergence of 
the series is the circle with centre Z Q passing through the point +1. 

The function 1 - is thus analytic at every point different from +1. 

With reference to this example, we may briefly draw attention to the 
following phenomenon, which becomes of fundamental importance in the theory 
of functions: If the geometric series 2z n , whose circle of convergence is the 
unit circle, is expanded by Taylor's theorem about a new centre z within the 
unit circle, we could assert with certainty, by that theorem, that the new series 
converges at least in the circle of centre z l which touches the unit circle on 
the inside. We now see that the circle of convergence of the new series may 
very possibly extend beyond the boundary of the old. This will always, be the 
case, in fact, when z t is not real and positive. If z t is real and negative, the 
new circle will indeed include the old one entirely. (Cf. footnote to 99, p 176.") 



55. The elementary analytic functions. I. Kational functions. 411 
2. Since a rational integral function 

<*o + a i z + a * z *-\ ----- 1" a m z m 

may be regarded as a power series, convergent everywhere, such 
functions are analytic in the whole plane. Hence the rational functions 
of general type 



are analytic at all points of the plane at which the denominator is 
not 0, i. e. everywhere, with the exception of a finite number of 
points. Their expansion in power series at a point z , at which the 
denominator is 4 s 0> * s obtained as follows: If z is replaced by 
z o + ( z *o) both in the numerator and denominator of such a function, 
these being then rearranged in powers of (z * ), the function takes 
the form 



where, on account ot our assumption, & ' 4. 0. We may now carry 
out the division in accordance with 105, 4 and expand the quotient 
in the required power series 26 of the form Sc n (s #o) n * 



II. The exponential function. 
The series 

is a power series converging everywhere, and therefore defines a func- 
tion regular in the whole plane, i. e. an integral function. To every 
point z of the complex plane there corresponds a definite number w, 
the sum of the above series. 

This function, which for real values of z has the value e z as de- 
fined in 33, may be used to define powers of the base e (and then 
further those of any positive base) for all complex exponents: 

80 An alternative method consists in first splitting 1 up the function into 
partial fractions. Leaving out of account any part which represents a rational 
integral function, we are then concerned with the sum of a finite number of 
fractions of the form 

A A i 1 \tf 



each of which we may, by 1, expand separately in a power series of the form 
2c n (g z )*, provided z 4= a. This method enables us to see, moreover, that 
the radius of the resulting* expansion will be equal to the distance of z from the 
nearest point at which the denominator of the given function vanishes. 



412 Chapter XII. Series ol complex terms. 

236. Definition. For all real or complex exponents, the meaning to be 
attributed to the power e* is defined, without ambiguity, by the 
relation 



And if p is any positive number, p z shall denote the value determined, 
without ambiguity, by the formula 



where log/> is the (real) natural logarithm of p as defined 21 in 36. 
(For a non-positive base b, the power b z can no longer be uniquely 
defined; cf., however, 244.) 

As there was no meaning attached per se to the idea of powers 
with complex exponents, we may interpret ihom in any manner we please. 
Reasons of suitability and convenience can alone determine the choice 
of a particular interpretation. That the definition just given is a th )r- 
oughly suitable one, results from formula 91, example 3 (leaving 
out of account the obvious requirement that the new definition must 
coincide with the old one for real values of the exponent 28 ); this formula 
was proved by means of a multiplication of series, the validity of which 
holds equally for real and complex variables and the formula must 
accordingly also hold for any complex exponent; it is 

237. ei e z * = e i+* 

whence also 



This important fundamental law for the algebra of powers therefore 
certainly remains true. At the same time it provides us with the key 
to the further study of the function e z . 

238. 1. Calculation of e z . For real y's, we have 



= cos y -f- i sin y . 



27 It may be noted how far removed this definition is from the elementary 
definition lt x k is the product of k factors all equal to x". At first sight, there is 
no knowing" what value belongs e. g. to 2 l ; yet this value is in any case uni- 
quely determined by the above definition. 

28 By 234, 2, there can exist no other function than the function a 2 just 
defined which is regular in the neighbourhood of the origin and coincides on 
the real axis z = x with the function e x defined by 33. For this reason we 
may indeed say that every definition of e z differing from the above would 
necessarily be unsuitable, 



55. The elementary analytic functions. 11. The exponential function. 413 
Hence it follows that, for z ~ x + i y> 

e* = e* + iv -== e x e iv e r (cos j/ 



By means of this lormula 20 the value of e z may easily be determined 
for all complex z's. 

This formula enables us, besides, to obtain in a convenient and 
complete manner an idea of the values which the function e z assumes 
at the various points of the complex plane (in short, of its stock of 
values}. We note the following facts. 

2. We have \e z \ = **<*> = e*. In fact 



\e**\ = (cosy -f isiny | Vcos 2 y -j-sin s y = 1, 

hence | e z \ = \ e x \ - \ e iy \ = e x , because e x > and the second factor 
= 1. Similarly, 

am e z = 3 (z) = y, 

also from the formula 238, 1 just used. 

3. e z has the periods 2kni, that is to say, for all values of z, 

e* = e *+**\ = e z *- 2 * w <, (k ^0, integral). 

For if we increase z by 2 71 i its imaginary part y increases by 2ji, 
\\ hile its real part remains unaltered, and by 1. and 24, 2, this leaves 
the value of the function unchanged. Every value which e z is able 
to assume accordingly occurs in the 
strip n < 3 (z) = y <i n, or in any 
strip which may be obtained from it 

by a parallel translation. Every such 

strip is called a period-strip; Pig. 11 
represents the first- named of these strips. 

4. e z has no other period, in- O 
deed, more precisely: if between two 

special numbers z and z^ we have 
the relation 



Fig. 11. 
this necessarily implies that 



For we first infer that e z *~~ z * = 1, then we note that if 
e z = e x + iv = ^(cos y -f- isiny) = 1,

414 Chapter XII. Series ot complex terms. 

we must by 2. have *=!, hence x = 0. Further, we also have 

cos y -f- i sin y = 1 
i. e. 

cos y = 1 , sin y = 0, 

hence y = 2 k n . Thus, as asserted, 



5. e* assumes every value w 4= owc0 awd only once in the period 
strip; or: the equation e z = w lt for given ^=^0, has one and only 
one solution in that strip. 

If w^ = R^ (cos ^ + * sin &J with # t > 0, the number 



is certainly a solution of e 3 = w t , as 
e zi = 6 \wRi e i'^ = R^ ( cos 

By 3., the numbers 



(ft = 0, 1, 2,...) 

are also solutions of the same equation, and by 4. no other solutions 

can exist. Now k may always be chosen, in one and only one way, 
so that 

n < 3 (^ -f 2 k n i} <^ + n, q. e. d. 

6. The value is never assumed by e z \ for, by 237, 

e z.e- z = \, 
so that e z can never be 0. 

7. The derivative (e z )' of e z is again e z y as follows at once by differ- 
entiating term-by-term the power series that defines e z . 

8. From 238, 1, we also deduce the special values 



III. The functions cos z and sin z. 

In the case of the trigonometrical functions, we can again use the 
expansions in power series convergent everywhere to define the functions 
239* for complex values of the variable. 

Definition. The sum of the power series, convergent everywhere,

by sin z, for every complex z. 



55. The elementary analytic functions. III. The functions cos z and sin z. 415 

For real z = x, this certainly gives us the former functions cos x 
and sin x. We have only to verify, as before, whether these defini- 
tions are suitable ones, in the sense that the functions defined, which 
are analytic in the whole plane, i.e. integral functions, possess the 
same fundamental properties as the real functions 30 cos x and sin x. 
Thai this is again the case, to the fullest extent, is shown by the 
following statement of their main properties: 

1. For every complex z, we have the formulae 240. 

cos #+ /sin # = 0*% 



whence further 

e ** + e -** . 

- -~ - , 81112 



(Eider's formulae). 

The proof follows immediately by replacing the functions on both 
sides by the power series which define them. 

2. The addition theorems remain valid for complex values of z: 
cos (z l + 2 3 ) = cos z t cos z.} sin z 1 sin z^, 
sin (^ -f- 2 2 ) = cos 2 i sm ^3 + sm %i cos -? 3 f 
This follows from 1., since by 237 



and the latter involves 

cosfo +* 9 ) + isin(* 1 +* 9 ) 

== (cos 2j + i sin zj (cos z a -f- i sin z a ) 

= (cos Z A cos z 2 sin ^ sin ^) -f- i (cos ^ sin z 2 -f sin 2:, cos *,) . 

Substituting z and z^ for ^j and 2 a , and taking into account the 
fact that cos z is an even, sinz an odd function, we obtain a similar 
formula, which differs from the last only in that i appears to be changed 
to i on either side. Addition and subtraction of the two relations 
give us the required addition formulae. 

3. The fact that the addition theorems for our two integral func- 
tions are formally the same as those for the functions cos a; and sin a; 
of the real variable x, not only sufficiently justifies our designating 
these functions by cos,? and sins, but shows, at the same time, that 
the entire formal machinery of the so-called goniometry t since it is 
evolved from the addition theorems, remains unaltered. In particular, 



90 Here again a remark analogous to that on p. 412, footnote 28, may 
be made. 



416 Chapter XII. Series ot complex terms. 

we have the formulae 

cos 3 z -f- sin 2 z = 1, cos 2 z = cos 9 z sin z 9 

sin 2 z = 2 sin z cos z, etc. 
valid without change for every complex z. 

4. The period-properties of the functions are also retained in the 
complex domain. For it follows from the addition theorems that 

cos (z -f- 2 n) = cos z cos 2 n sin z sin 2 rc = cos 2, 
sin (2 -f- 2 JT) = cos 2 sin 2 JT + sin 2 cos 2 JT = sin 2 . 



5. 77*0 functions cos z aw<2 sin z possess no other zeros in the com- 
plex domain besides those already known in the real domain* 1 . In fact, 
cos z = necessarily involves, by 1., e iz = e~ iz or 



i. e. 

By 238, 4, this can only occur when 

Similarly, sinz = implies e iz ~ e" iz , or e* iz = 1, i. e. 2 iz = 2 k jit, 
or z = kn, q. e. d. 

6. The relation cos z = cos z 2 is satisfied if, and only if, 
z ^ = -j- z ^ -. 2 kn, i. e. under the same condition as in the real 
domain. Similarly sm z^ = sin z^ if, and only if t z^ = z -f- 2 k n or 
z g = n z + 2 k n. It follows in fact from 

cos z, cos 2 2 = 2 sm -~^ - 2 sin - 1 -,, 3 - = ,

by 5., that either - JL -Q fl r S>~ 2 must = ft JT; similarly it follows from

by 5., that either -^^ = ft ^ or ^-^ = (2 A + 1) -*- . 



7. 77z functions cos,? aw^ sin^r assume every complex value w 
in the period-strip, i. e. in the strip n < $1 (z) <I -f- n, the equations 
cos 2 = w and sin 2 = w have indeed exactly two solutions in that strip, 
if w ^ l, but only one, if ze> = 1. 



81 Or in other words: The sum of the power series 1 - -| ... = if,

Proof. In order to have cos z ~- w, we must have e iz -\- e~ iz 2 10

of the two numbers, for instance 72(0)8-?* +isin-~V whose square is 

the quantity under the radical c ign.) 
Since in any case 32 w + Vw 2 1 =}= 0, 
there certainly exists a complex num- 
ber / such that - n < 3(Y) < +n, 
foi which e z ' = w -\-V w* 1,

or cos z = w. This 

equation therefore certainly has at 
least one solution in the penod-stnp. 
By 6., however, a second solution, 
different from it, (viz. z), exists 
in the period -strip if, and only if, 
z =H and =f= n, i. e. w + 1- 

We reason in precisely the same manner with regard to the 
equation sin z -- w. In this case, we can also easily convince our- 
selves that there is always one and only one solution of the equation 
in the portion of the period-strip left unshaded in Fig 12, if we in- 
clude the parts of the rim indicated in black, but omit the parts re- 
presented by the dotted lines (see VI below). 

8. For the derivatives, we have as in the real case, 
(cos z)' sin 3, (sin z)' cos z. 

IV. The functions cot# and tan^gr. 
1. Since cos z and sin z are analytic in the whole plane, the functions 



cot z = ^? and 

sin z 



tan z = -- 

cos z 



will also be regular in the whole plane, with the exception of the points 
k TT for the former and (2 k + 1) for the latter, which are the zeros of 

sin z and cos z respectively. Their expansions in power series may be 
obtained by carrying out the division of the cosine and sine series. Since 
this operation is of a purely formal nature, the result must be the same 
as it was in the real domain. Accordingly, by 24, 4, where the result 
of this division was obtained by a special artifice, we have

418 Chapter XII. Series oi complex terms. 

On account of 94 and 136, we are now also in a position to de 
termine the exact radius of convergence of these series. The absolute 
value of the coefficient of z 2k in the first series, by 136, is 



Its (2A) th root is

cot 2r and tan 2 asswme every complex value w =f= * /ws^ once; /Ae

For each w *%* i, is a definite complex number 4 s an( * (by 
II, 5) there accordingly exists a / such that n <. % (/) <^ n>

By 2. there can be no other solution in this strip. The impossibility

of a solution for cot z = * results from the fact that these equations 
both involve 



which cannot be satisfied by any value of z, as cos a z + sin a = 1. 
For tans the procedure is quite similar. 

4. The expansion in partial fractions deduced in 24, 5 for the 
cotangent in the real domain remains valid in the same form for every 
complex z different from 0, 1* it 2,... (and similarly for the ex- 

pansions of tans, etc.). Indeed the complete reasoning given 

there may be interpreted in the "complex" sense, without altering a 
single word 33 . In particular, for every z satisfying the above con- 
dition, 



Now 



it follows, if we substitute z for 2inz, that

hence we obtain the expansion 

i i 1 



valid for every complex z=$=2kni (&0, integer). This is the ex- 
tension to the complex variable z of the remarkable expansion in partial 
fractions obtained on p. 378, and it exhibits the true connection 
between this expansion and that of cots, which previously seemed 
rather fortuitous. 

V. The logarithmic series. 
In 25, we saw that the series 



represents for every | x \ < 1 the inverse function of the exponential 
function e v 1; i. e. substituting for y in 



3! 



33 It was precisely for this purpose that at the time we framed some of our 
estimates in a form somewhat different from that required for the real domain 
(e. g. those on pp. 200 207 to which footnote 26 refers). 



420 Chapter XII. Series of complex terms. 

the above series and rearranging (as is certainly allowed) in powers of 
x, we reduce the new series simply to x. This fact because it is purely 
formal in character necessarily remains when complex quantities are 
considered. Hence, for every | z \ < 1,

We now adopt for the complex domain the 

242. Definition. A number a is said to be a natural logarithm of c, in 
symbols, 

a =- log c f 
if e = c. 

In accordance with II, 5, we may then assert that every complex 
number c 4= possesses one, and only one, logarithm whose imaginary 
part lies between TT exclusive and + ^ inclusive (to the number 0, 
however, by II, 6, no logarithm can be assigned at all). This uniquely 
defined value will be more especially referred to as the principal value 
of the natural logarithm of c. Besides this value, there is an infinity of 
other logarithms of c, since with e a = c we have also e a + 2k = c\ thus 
if a is the principal value of the logarithm of c, the numbers 

a + 2 k TT i (k ^ 0, integer) 

must also be called logarithms of c. These values of the logarithm (for 
k =*= 0) are called its subsidiary values M . By 238, 4 there can be no further 
logarithms of c. We have, for each of its values, 

ffl (log*) = log | c | , 3 (log c) = amc, 

if in the first of these relations log | c \ denotes the (single-valued) real 
logarithm of the positive number \c\, and the second is interpreted as 
meaning that, taken as a whole, all the values of the one side are equal to 
all the values of the other. 

With these definitions, we may assert in any case that the above series 
(L) provides a logarithm of (1 + #) But we mav at once prove more, 
namely the 

43. Theorem. The logarithmic series (L) gives, at each point of the unit 
circle (including its rim, with the exception of the point 1), the principal 
value of log (1 + #). 



34 If c is real and positive, the principal value of log c coincides with the (real) 
natural logarithm as formerly defined (36, Def.). 



55. The elementary analytic functions VI. The inverse sine series. 421 

Proof. That the series converges for each z =t= - 1 for which 
| z | ^ 1 was shown in 230, 3. (We have only to put % for z there.) 
For this z, am(l -|- #) has precisely that value iff for which

Hence we have, for the imaginary part of the sum w of the series (L), 
(3) 3(w) = 



with integral k. Now w is a continuous function of z in | z \ <. 1, and 
assumes the value 1 for xr 0. Hence 3 (w) too is a continuous function 
in | # | < 1. Therefore, in the equation (^)> ^ must have the same value 
for all these z. But for JST \\e have clearly to take k 0; hence this 
is its value in the whole of j % \ < 1. Finally \ve learn from the application 
of Abel's limit theorem that the sum of our series is still equal to the prin- 
cipal value of log (1 + z) at the points 2 =|= 1 for which | z \ = 1. 



VI. The inverse sine series. 

We saw in III, 7 that the equation sin w = #, for a given complex 
~ ^ 1, has exactly two solutions, for xr - -[ : 1 exactly one, in 
the strip TT < j)f (77) ^ + TT. The two solutions (by III, 6) arc sym- 
metrical, either with respect to + \ or ^; accordingly, we may assert 

more precisely that the equation sin w ^- z, for an arbitrary given z (in- 
clusive of 1), has one and only one solution in the strip 

- I ^ SB (w) ^ + f , 

if the lower portions of its rim, from the real axis downwards, arc omitted 
(cf. Fig. 12, where the parts of the rim not counted with the strip are 
drawn in dotted lines, and the others are marked by a continuous black 
line). This value of the solution of the equation sin w = z, which is thus 
uniquely defined for every complex ^r, is called the principal value of the 
function 

tv sin" 1 z. 

All the remaining values arc contained, by III, 6, in the two formulae 

sin" 1 z -\- 2k TT, 
TT sin" 1 z + 2 k TT, 

and may be called subsidiary values of the function.

For real values of x such that |as| <l, the series 123, 

. 1 x 9 , 1-8 * B , 
? ==a; + -2--3- + 274Tr + - 

represents the inverse series of the sine power series 



Exactly the same considerations as in V. for the case of the log- 
arithmic series now show that, for complex values of z such that | z \ <J 1 , 
the series 

. 1 z 9 . 1-3 * B , 
"' + T-T+2-4-5- + "- 

w* 
is the inverse series of the sine power series w -- ^7 -| -- . It 

therefore gives at any rate one of the values of sin" 1 z. That this 
actually is the principal value, may be seen from the fact that, for 



== sin" 1 |z| <: sin"" 1 1 = -J, 
a condition which the principal value alone fulfils. 

VII. The inverse tangent series. 

The equation tant0 = z, as we know from IV, 3, has for every given 
z =|= i i one and only one solution in the strip -- - < 91 (w) <^ -f" -^- . 
This is called the principal value of the function 



the other values of which (by IV, 2) are then obtained from the formula 
tan" 1 z + k 7t . The equations tan z = i have no solutions whatever. 
Almost word for word the same considerations as above again 
show that, for | z \ <T 1 , the series 

(A) = 2 _.+._ +... 

gives one of the solutions of tznw z. To show that this is actually 
the principal value of tan"" 1 ,?, we have to show that the real part of 

the sum of the series lies between -- 5- (exclusive) and -f- -5- (inclusive). 

This remains true for every z 4 s i on | * | =* 1> as we ^ as for | ar | < 1, 
and is proved as follows: 

The sum w of the series (A), as may be seen by substituting the 
log-series, is 

w = -^j-log (1 + iz) -^-log (1 iz) 



55. The elementary analytic functions. VIII. The binomial series. 423 

for every \z\ <[ 1, z 4 s i> where principal values are taken for both 
logarithms. Accordingly, 

SRW = y3log(l + ^)~|3lo g (l-^); 
by 243, both terms of the difference lie between - and + ~ , 

hence fR (w) lies between ~ and -f- ~rr > me two extreme values 
being excluded in either case. Thus the series (A) certainly represents 
the principal value of tan" 1 ,?, provided |z|<^l and z + i> q- e. d. 

VIII. The binomial series. 

To complete our present treatment of the special power series in- 
vestigated in the real domain, we have only to consider the bino- 
mial series 



in the case where the quantities occurring there i. e. the exponent a 
as well as the variable x assume complex values. We start with the 

Definition. The name of principal value of the power b a , where 244. 
a and b denote any complex numbers, with b 4 s as the only condi- 
tion, is given to the number uniquely defined by the formula 



when log b is given its principal value. By choosing other values of 
log b 9 we obtain further \alues of the power, which may be called its 
subsidiary values. All these values are contained in the formula 

ta ^a[\ogb+2kai] 
u 6 , 

each value being represented exactly once, if log b is given its prin- 
cipal value and k takes all integral values ^0. 

Remarks and Examples. 

1. A power 6 fl accordingly has an infinite number of values in general, 
but possesses one and only one principal value. 

2. The symbol **, for instance, denotes the infinity of numbers (all real 
numbers, moreover) 



, ( ft= , 1. 2, .. ) 

a 

of which e 2 is the principal value of the power **. 

3. The only case in which a power b a will not have an infinite number 
of values is that in which 

*" (ft-0, 1,2. ...) 



424 



Chapter XII. Series of complex terms. 



gives only a finite number of values; this will occur if, and only if, ka 
assumes, for = 0, 1, 2, ..., only a finite number of essentially different 
values. Here two numbers arc described (just for the moment) ,is essentially 
different if, and only if, they do not differ merely by a (real) integer. i\ow 
this is the case if, and only if, a is a real rational number, as may be seen 
at once; and the number of "essentially different" values which may in this 
case be assumed by k-a is given by the smallest positive denominator with 
which a may be written in fractional form. 

J. 

4. Tt follows that b m = yb, where m is a positive integer, has exactly 
m different values, one of which is quite definitely distinguished as the prin- 
cipal value. 

">. Tne number of different values of b a will reduce to one, by 3. and 4., if, 
and only if, a is a rational number of denominator I, i. e. a real integer. For all 
real integral exponents (but for these alone), the power thus remains now as before 
a single-valued symbol. 

6. If b is positive and a real, the value formerly defined (v. 33) as the 
power b a is now the principal value of this power. 

7. Similarly, the values defined in 23G for e z and p z , (>0), are now, 
more precisely, the principal values of these powers In themselves, these sym- 
bols would represent, for complex values of z, an infinity of vakus, in ac- 
cordance with our last definition. Nevertheless, we shall keep in future to the 
convention that e z , and generally p z for any positive p t shall represent the value 
defined by 236, i e the principal value only 

8. The following theorems will show that it is consistent to define b a also 
for b = when fll(a);>0. The value attributed to the po\\er in th.it case is 
(uniquely). 

After making these preliminary preparations, we proceed to prove 
the following far-reaching 

Theorem 35 . For any complex exponent a and any complex z in 
| z | < 1 , the binomial series 



converges and has for sum the principal value of the power 

(1+1)-. 

Proof The convergence follows word for word as in the case 
of real zs and 's (v pp 200 -210), so that we haxr only to prove the 
statement as to the sum of the series. Now for real x's such that \x \ < 1, 
and real a's, we may substitute

for y in the exponential series = ! + )/ + --] and so obtain, 

after learranging in powers of x fallowed by 1O4), the power series 
for s log u + *) = (l -f ar), i. e. the binomial series ("\x n . Let us 

proceed in this manner, purely formally in the first instance, assuming 
complex and writing z for x; i. e. we substitute 

'x* ( ]\ n 1 ^ iti n 

w = a .2 { -^ z n in e^^Z^-r 

nl n n=l nl 

and rearrange in powers of z. We necessarily obtain without refer- 
ence as yet to any question of convergence the series 



whose sum would therefore be proved to be gi (*+*) = (l -f- z) a (where 
the principal value is taken for the logarithm and hence for the power 
also), if we could show that the rearrangement carried out was per- 
missible. Now by 1O4 this is certainly so; in fact the exponential 

series converges everywhere and the series cc - -- z n remains 

convergent for | z | <. 1 when a and all the terms of the senes are 
replaced by their absolute values. This proves the theorem in its full 
extent. 

If we split up (1 + z) a into its real and imaginary parts, we obtain 
a formula due to Abel, which is complicated in appearance, but which 
for that very reason shows how far-reac hing a result is contained in 
the preceding theorem, and from which we also obtain a means for 
evaluating the power (1 -f- z) a . Writing z = r (cos cp -f- i sin cp) and 
a = /3 + iy, < r < 1 , r/>, /?, / all real, and writing 

1 + z = R (cos + i sin 0) , 
we have 



R = Vl + 2ycos//? + y' 2 , = principal value 3G of tan- 1 - 
With these values of R and 0, we thus obtain 



= Rfi . e -y * [cos (00 + y log R) + i sin (ji& + y log R)] . 

For the case |^|<1, theorem 245 and the remark just made 
completely answer the question as to the sum of the binomial series. 
We have now only to consider the points of the circumference | z \ = 1 . 
From Abel's theorem, together with the continuity of the principal value 
of log (1 -f- z) for every 2 =}= 1 in | z \ <[ 1 and the continuity of the 
exponential function, we at once deduce the

246. Theorem. At every point of the rim |2| = 1 of the unit circle, 
at which the binomial series continues to converge, except possibly for 
2 = 1, its sum remains now as previously the principal value of 

(! + *)-. 

The determination whether, and for what values of a and z, the 
binomial series continues to converge on ike rim of the unit circle 
presents no difficulties after the preparations made in this respect (and 
chiefly for this purpose) in 53. The theorem we have is the following, 
which sums up the entire question once more:

247. Theorem. The binomial series J^( }z n reduces, for real integ- 

n=o > n ' 

ral values of tf^O, to a finite sum, and has then the (ipso facto 
unique) value (\-\-z) a \ in particular for a = it has the value 1 (also 
when z = 1) . // # does not have one of these values, the series con- 
verges absolutely for \ z \ < 1 and diverges for \z\ > 1 , while it exhibits 
the following behaviour on the circumference \ z \ = 1 : 

a) if 91 (a) > , it converges absolutely at all points on the circum- 
ference', 

b) if 91 (a) ^ 1, it diverges at all these points; 

c) if 1 < 91 (a) <I 0, it diverges at z = 1 and converges con- 
ditionally at every other point of the circumference. 

The sum of the series when it converges is invariably the principal 
value of (I -\- z) a ; in particular, its value is in the case z = 1. 

Proof. Writing ( l) w (") = n + 1 , we have

hence theorem 229 may be applied, and the validity of a), b) and c) 
follows immediately. Only the case of the point z = 1, i. e. the con- 
vergence of the series 



requires special investigation. Now

and in general, as may at once be verified by induction: 



the partial sums of our series are equal to the paitial products, with 

00 / cc \ 
the same index n, of the product //fl ) The behaviour of this 

product is immediately evident. In fact 

1. If <K(a) = /?>0, choose ft* such that </?'</?; for every 
sufficiently large n, say n^tm, 

hence 



By 12t>, 2, it follows at once that the partial products, and hence the 
partial sums of our series, tend to 0. The series therefore converges 37 
to the sum 0. 

2. If, however, R (a) = ft < 0, we have 

a

whence it again follows by multiplication that 



and hence that the left hand side tends to oo. The series therefore 
diverges in this case. 

3. If, finally, $ (a) ~ 0, a = i y, say, with y ^ 0, the w th partial 
sum of our scries is 



The fact that this value tends to no limit as n + + ma y De proved 
most speedily in the present connection as follows: On account of the ab- 

solute convergence of the series J?( J , we have, by 29, theorem 10. 



Letting w> + oo, the right hand side evidently tends to no limit; on 
the contrary, the points which it represents for successive values of n 
circulate incessantly round the circumference of the unit circle in a 
constant sense, the interval between successive points becoming smaller 



37 The mere convergence of (!)*( J follows already from 228 and 

we see that the convergence is absolute when SR(a)>0. It is the fact of the 
sum being which requires the artifice employed above for its detection.

and smaller at each turn. In view of the asymptotic relationship, 
the same is therefore true of the left hand side. Hence our series 

J( l) w ( J also diverges when s Ji(a) = 0. Thus theorem 247 is 

established in all its parts, the behaviour of the binomial series is de- 
termined for every value of z and of a, and its sum for all points 
of convergence is given by means of a "closed expression". 



56. Series of variable terms. Uniform convergence. 

theorem on double series. 



The fundamental remarks on series of variable terms 



n=0 

are substantially the same for the complex as for the real domain 
(v. 46); but instead of the common interval of definition we must 
now assume a common region of definition, which for simplicity 
this is also quite sufficient for most purposes we shall suppose to 
be a circle (cf. p. 403, footnote 17). We accordingly assume that 

1. A circle \z z \ < r exists, in which the functions f n (z) are 
all defined. 

2. For every individual z in the circle \ z Z Q \ < r, the series 

n=0 

is convergent. 

The scries 2 f n (z) then has, for every z in the circle, a definite 
sum, whose value therefore defines a function of z (in the sense of 
the definition on p. 403). We accordingly write 

00 

2fn(*) = F(z). 

=0 

The same problems as those discussed in 46 and 47 for the 
case of real variables anse in connection with the functions represented 
by complex series of variable terms. In the real domain, however, 
it is of the greatest importance, both for the theory and its appli- 
cations, to make use of the concept of function in its most general 
form, while in the complex domain this has not been fou:id profitable. 
The usual restriction, which is sufficiently wide for all ordinary pur- 
poses, is to consider analytic functions only. We therefore assume 
further that 

3. The functions f n (z) are all analytic in the circle \ z 2 | < r, 
i. e. expressible by power series with z as centre and radius not less 
than a fixed number r. 



$ 56. Series of variable terms. 429 

We then speak for brevity of series of analytic functions**; 

the chief problem concerning such a series is the following: Is the 
function F(z) which it represents analytic in the circle \z | < ?> 
or not? Precisely as in the real domain, it may be shown by examples 
that without further assumptions this need not be the case. On the 
other hand, the desired behaviour of F(z) may be ensured by stipul- 
ating (cf. 47, first paragraph) that the series converges uniformly. 
The definition for this is almost word for word a repetition of 191: 

Definition (2 nd form 39 ). A series 2 f n (z), all of whose terms are 248. 
defined in the circle \ z z a \ < r or in the circle \ z Z Q \ <^ r, and 
which converges in this circle, is said to converge uniformly in this 
circle if, for every e > 0, it is possible to choose a single number 
N > (independent, therefore, of z) such that 



for every n > N and every z in the circle considered. 

Remarks. 

1. Uniformity of convergence is here considered relative to all the points of 
an open or closed circle* . Of course other types of region or indeed arcs 
of curves or any other set $)t of points, not merely finite in number, may be 
taken as a basis for the definition. The definition remains the same in sub- 
stance. Tn applications, we shall usually be concerned with the case in 
which the terms f n (z) are defined, and the series 2f n (z) converges, at every 
point interior to a circle |* z |<; r (or a domain 0)), but the convergence 
is uniform only in a smaller circle \ z Z Q \ < g, uhcre < r, (or in a smaller sub- 
domain j, which, together with, its boundary, belongs to the interior of (i)) 

2 If the power series ~a n (z z ) n has the radius r, and 0<0<>, the series 
is uniformly convergent in the (closed) circle \Z ZQ\<Q- Proof word for 
word as on p. 333. 

3. If r is the exact radius of convergence of 2 a n (z z ) n , the conver- 
gence is not necessarily uniform in the circle | z z \ < f . Example the geo- 
metric series, proof on p 333. 

4. Exactly as befoie, we may verify that our definition is completely 
equivalent to the following: 



88 Here again we may remark (cf. 190, 4) that there is no substantial 
difference between the treatment of series of variable terms and that of sequences 
of functions A series 2f n (z) is equivalent to the sequence of its partial sums 
s (z), Sj (z), . . ., and a sequence of functions s n (z) is equivalent to the series 

s fl (*)+(, (*) -* (*))H For simplicity, we shall hereafter formulate all 

definitions and theorems for series alone; the student will easily be able to 
enunciate them for sequences. 

89 This definition corresponds to the former 2 nd form. The 1 st form 191 
may here be omitted, as it did not appear essential for the application of 
the concept of uniform convergence, but only for its introduction. 

43 The set of points of a circle (or, for short, the citcle itself) is said to 
be closed or open according as the points of the circumference are regarded 
as included in the set or not. 



430 Chapter XII. Series of complex terms. 

3 rd form. S f n (z) is said to be uniformly convergent in \ * * | < Q (or in 
the set 9ft), if, for every choice of points z n belonging to this circle (or set), the 
corresponding remainders r n (z n ) always form a null sequence. 

The 4 th and 5 th forms of the definition (p. 335) also remain entirely un 
altered and we may dispense with a special statement of them here. 

On the other hand, it is impossible to give as impressive a geometrical 
representation of uniform and non-uniform convergence of a series as in the 
real domain. 

We are now in a position to formulate and prove the theorem 
announced. 

249. Weierstrass 9 theorem on double series 41 . We suppose given a 

series 



each of whose terms f k (z) is analytic at least for \z z \ < r, so that 
the expansions 42 



all exist and converge at least for \z z Q \<r. Further, we assume 
that the series 2f^(z) converges uniformly in the circle \ z z \ < , 
for every Q < r, so that the series converges, in particular, everywhere 
within the circle \z z Q \<r, and represents a definite function F(z) 
there. It may then be shown that.

i. e. the successive derived functions of F (z) may be obtained by term-by-term 
differentiation of the given series , and each of the new series converges uniformly 
in every circle \ % # | 5^ , with g < r. 

Remarks. 

1. If we direct our attention primarily to expansions in power series, the 
theorem simply states that with the assumptions detailed above, an infinite number 
of power series "may" be added term by term. If on the other hand we look rather 
at the analytic character of the various functions, we have the following 

Theorem. If each of the functions f k (z) is regular for \ z s | < r and the 
series 27/ fc (z) converges uniformly in \ z z \ ^ g, for every g < r, then this series 
represents an analytic function F (z), regular in the circle \ z Z Q \ < r. The succes- 
sive derived functions JFX") (z) of F (z) t for every v ^ 1, are represented^ in that circle \ 
by the serie* </&(") (z), obtained from 2f k (z) by differentiating term by term, v times 
in succession. Each of these series converges uniformly in every circle \ z ar | 5^ g, 
with Q < r. 

2. The assumption that 27/ 7c (z) converges in | z # | 5C g for every g < r 
is satisfied, for instance, by every power series 27 c k (z z Q ) k with radius of con- 

vergence r. It is also satisfied e. g. by the series J 1 _ - -, for r = 1 ; cf. 58, C. 

*^ 1 ~~~ s 

3. The first of our four statements shows that the present theorem cannot 
be proved simply as an application of Markoff's transformation of series; for the 
latter assumes the convergence of the columns, here this is deduced from the 
other hypotheses. 

Proof. 1 . Let an index m, a positive g < r and an e > be chosen 
to be kept fixed throughout. By hypothesis, we can determine a k Q such 
that, throughout | z Z Q \ <^ g, 



for every k such that k' > k > A , if we write 

** = ** (*) =/o (*) + ...+/* (*) 

Now the function s k > (z) s k (z) is a definite power series, whose i7t th 
coeiBcient is 



By Cauchy's inequality 235, we therefore have 



Hence the series 

(a) *W +<> + + + = 

A-0 

is convergent, by 81. Let A m be its sum. As m could be chosen arbitrarily, 
the first of our statements is thus established. 



432 Chapter XII. Series of complex terms. 

2. Now let M' be the maximum 43 of | s fco ^ i (z) \ along the circum- 
ference | z - Z Q | = y. We have then for every k > k on the same cir- 
cumference 

I ** (*) I ^ I **.+ 1 (*) I + I ** (*) - % + i (*) \M' + t' = M. 
Again, using Cauchy's inequality, we obtain, for every n - 0, 1, 2, . . . , 



whatever the value of k. Hence 

M

and 27 A n (z z Q ) n therefore converges for | z z \ < &. Since the only 

n^O 

restriction on g was that it should be < r, the series must even converge 
for | z z | < r. (In fact, if z is any determinate point satisfying the 
inequality | z Z Q \ < r, it is always possible to assume Q to be chosen 
so that | z Z Q | < Q < r.) Let us for the moment denote by F l (z) the 
function represented by the series A n (z #o) n " ft ^ s thus, by its defini- 
tion, an analytic function in | z ^ | < r. 

3. We have now to show that F l (z) = F (z), so that F (z) is itself 
an analytic function regular in | z Z Q \ < r. For this purpose, we choose, 
as in the first part of our proof, a positive (/ < r y a positive Q in Q' < # < r, 
and an e > 0, fixed. We can determine k so that, for all z in | z xr | fj , 



for every k such that k' > k > & . By Cauchy's inequality, it follows as 
before that, for k' > k > k and for every n ^ 0, 



Making &' -> + , we infer that, for every k > k and every n S 0, 
I A n - ( + <*> + + an*) I ^ 

Now the expression between the modulus signs is the w th coefficient in

the expansion of F l (z) Zf v (z) in powers of (z z ). Hence we have,

for | z Z Q | < g:

Thus, when e > and Q' < Q < r have been chosen arbitrarily, we 



can determine k so that

these values of z ^ 



r=0 

The numbers @' and were subjected to no restriction other than

for every z interior to the circle | z z \ < r.

where the sum of the coefficients in any one column converges to the 
value written immediately below them. Just as in 3. (we have only 
to begin our evaluations with e' = ( Q Q Y e) we deduce that for 
| z Z Q \ ^ e r < Q < r and every k > 7e , 



Hence for those values of z y F' (z) = 2f k ' (z). Indeed, by the same 

A-O* 

reasoning as before, this series converges uniformly in | z Z Q \ < r, for 
every g <. r. If we write down the corresponding system of series for the

1. A few examples of particular importance will be discussed in detail in

2. The fact of assuming the convergence uniform in a circular domain is 
immaterial for the most essential part of the theorem: If G is a domain of arbitrary 
shape 44 and if every point Z Q of the domain is the centre of a circle | z ar | g g 
(for some Q) which belongs entirely to the domain, is such that each term of the series 
Zfj. (z) is analytic there, and is a circle of uniform convergence of the given series, 
then this series also represents a function F (sr) analytic in the domain in question, 
whose derived functions may be obtained by differentiation term by term. Examples 
of this will also be given in 58.

434 Chapter XI 1. Series of complex terms. 

57. Products with complex terms. 

The developments of Chapter VII were conducted in such a way 
that all definitions and theorems relating to products with "arbitrary" 
terms hold without alteration when we admit complex values for the 
factors. In particular the definition of convergence 125 and the theo- 
rems 1 , 2 and 5 connected with it, as well as the proofs of the latter, 
remain entirely unchanged. There is also nothing to modify in 127, the 
definition of absolute convergence, and the related theorems 6 and 7. 
On the other hand, some doubt might arise as to the literal trans- 
ference of theorem 8 to the complex domain. Here again, however, 
everything may be interpreted as "complex", provided we agree to 
take log (1 + a J to mean the principal value of the logarithm, for every 
sufficiently large n. The reasoning requires care, and we shall therefore 
carry out the proof in full: 

250. Theorem. The product 77(1 + 0J converges if, and only if, the 
series, starting with a suitable index m, 



whose terms are the principal values of log (1 + a n ), converges. If L m is 
the sum of this series, we have, moreover, 

77(1 -|- a n ) = (1 + a,) (1 + * 2 ) . . . (1 + a m ) *'-. 
n-i 

Proof, a) The conditions are sufficient. For if the series 
O w * m tne principal values of the logarithms, is con- 



n-m+i 

vergent, its partial sums s n , (n > m), tend to a definite limit L, and 
consequently, since the exponential function is continous at every 
point, 



i. e. it certainly tends to a value + 0. Hence the product is con- 
vergent in accordance with the definition 125 and has the value 
stated. 

b) The conditions are necessary. For, if the product converges, 
given a positive e, which we may assume < 1, we can determine n 
so that 

(a) | (1 



for every n ^> n Q and every fcj>l. We then have, in particular, 
I a n | < ~ < -g- for every n > n , and the inequality | a n \ < -- is thus 

certainly fulfilled for every n greater than a certain index m. We may 
now show further that for the same values of n and k hisine' the

(b) 



n I k

<e 





and therefore the series 27 log (1 + a n ) is convergent. In fact, as | a v \ < ^ 

Ji-mi-l * 

for every v > 0> we also have 46 , for these values of v, 
(c) I log (! + ,) | <e, 

and likewise, by (a), 

I log [(1 + re+1 ) . . . (1 + +*)] I < * 

for every w ^ w and every k ^ 1. Accordingly, for some suitable integer 47 
q y we certainly have 

| log (1 + a n+ J + log(l + a n ^) + . . . + log(l + a n+k ) + 2qni\<s, 

and it only remains to show that q may in every case be taken = 0. Now 

if we take any particular n ^ # , this is certainly true for k = 1, by (c). 

It follows that it is true for k = 2. For in the expression 

log (1 + a n+1 ) + log (1 + a n+2 ) + 2q*i 

the modulus of either of the two first terms < e, by (c), and by (d) the 
modulus of the whole expression has to be < e; as e < 1, q cannot, there- 
fore, be an integer different from 0. For corresponding reasons, it also 
follows that for k = 3 the integer q must be 0, and this is then easily seen 
by induction to be true for every k. This establishes the theorem. 

The part of theorem 127, 8 relating to absolute convergence may 
also be immediately transferred to the complex domain, viz. 

no 00 

the series 2 log (1 + a n ) and the product // (1 + a n ) 

n = m + 1 n -m \ \ 

are simultaneously absolutely or non-absolutely convergent, in every case. 
Similarly the theorems 9 11 of 29 and 30 remain valid. In fact, it 

remains true for complex a n y s of modulus < - that in 



45 The logarithms are always taken to have their principal values in what 
follows. 

46 In fact, for | a | < ~, 

I log (i + *) | ^ | * | + L* |a + . . . ^ | * ! + i * p + . . . = -jJ* Lj < 2 1 z | . 

47 For the principal value of the logarithm of a product is not necessarily 
the sum of the principal values of the logarithms of the factors, but may differ from 

this sum by a multiple of 2 TT i. Thus e. g. log i = k> - , but 

log (i *"" = log 1 = 0, 
if we take principal values throughout. 



436 Chapter Xll. Series ot complex terms. 

the quantities ?^ n are bounded, since when | z \ < 4 . 



while the expression in square brackets clearly has its modulus < 1 
for those z's. 

Finally, the remarks on the general connection between series 
and products also hold without alteration, since they were purely formal 
in character. 

251* Examples. 

* IL (1 + "-) is Divergent. For 2 \ a n | 2 == s is convergent, so that 
by 29, theorem 10, the partial products 



the right hand expression represents, for successive values of , points on the 
circumference of the unit circle, which circulate incessantly round this circum- 
ference at shorter and shorter intervals. p n therefore tends to no limiting 
value. (Cf. pp. 4278.)

of this product is obvious by 127, 7 and its n th partial product multiplied by 
(1-*) is 



which tends to 1. 

The consideration of products whose terms are functions of a 
complex variable, 



n=l 

like that of series of variable terms in the preceding section, 
will be restricted to the simplest, but also the most important case, 
in which the functions f n (z) are all analytic in one and the same circle 
| z _ ZQ | <; r (i. e . possess an expansion in power series com crgent in 
that circle) and in which the product also converges everywhere in 
the circle. The product then represents a definite function F(z) in 
the circle, which is said, conversely, to be expanded in the given 
product. 

We next enquire under what convenient conditions the function 
F(z) represented by ihe product is also analytic in the circle 
|2 2 |<?. For the great majority of applications, the following 
theorem is sufficient: 



57. Products with complex terms. 437 

Theorem. // the functions f l (xr), / 2 (xr), . . . , f n (xr), . . . are all analytic 252. 
at least in the (fixed) circle \ z xr | < r ; if, further, the series 



n-l 



converges uniformly in the smaller circle \ z z \ ^ g, for every positive 
(j < r\ then the product //(I +/ n (#)) converges everywhere in \ z xr | < r 
and represents a function F (z) which is itself analytic in that circle. 

The proof follows the same line of argument as that of the 
continuity theorem 218, 1 almost word for word. To establish the con- 
vergence and analytic character of the product at a particular point z l 
in the circle | z z | < r, we choose a g < r and prove the two facts 
first for every % of the circle | z Z Q \ <Q. The series 2 \ f n (z) \ converges 
uniformly in the whole of | z # | ^ g, so that the product //(I +/ n (z)) 
certainly converges there (indeed absolutely). Choose m so large that 



verges there (indeed absolutely). Choose 

I / m +l (*) I + I /,+ 2 (*) I + + I fn (*) | 





< 1 

for every n > m and every | z Z Q \ ^ Q ; then for all these w's and #*s, 
| Pn (z)\ = | (1 +/ whl (*)) ... (1 +/ n (ar)) I ^ e I/ M+1 Wl + - + !/<*) I < 3. 
It follows precisely as on p. 382 that the series 

/Wl + (Pm+* Pm+l) + + (Pn ^n-l) + 

converges uniformly in | z Z Q \ ^ Q. As all the terms of this series are 
analytic in | z Z Q \ < r, the series itself, by 249, therefore represents 
a function F m (z) analytic in | # Z Q \ < g. Hence 



F(*) =- II (I +/ (*)) = (1 +A (*)) ... (1 +/, (*)) F m (z) 

w-1 

is also an analytic function, regular in that circle. 

From the above considerations, we may deduce two further theorems, 
which provide an analogue to Weierstrass 1 theorem on double series: 

Theorem 1. With the assumptions of the preceding theorem, the ix-253. 
pansion in power series of F (z) may be obtained by expanding the product 
term by term. More precisely, we know that the (finite) product 

P* (*) = //(!+/,(*)) 

P=l 

may be expanded in a power series of centre Z Q which converges for 
| z ZQ | < r, since this is the case with each of the functions f lt / 2 , . . . .

Then for each (fixed] n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., the limit

Proof. By 46, theorem 2, the uniform convergence, in 
I z z I ^ , of the scries 



used in the preceding proof, implies the uniform convergence in the 
same circle of the series 48 

PI W + [P. W - PX ()] + + [P k W - P*-, (*)] + 

Applying W^f^ys^rass' theorem on double series to this series, we 
obtain precisely the theorem stated. 

Finally we prove a theorem about the derived function of F(z], 
quite similar to 218,2: 

Theorem 2. For every z in \z - Z Q \ < r for which F(z)*^Q, 
we have 



*. . //t^ series on the right hand side converges for all these values 
of z and gives the ratio on the left hand side, the logarithmic dif- 
ferential coefficient of F(z). 

Proof. We saw that the expansion 

F(z) = PI(Z) + (P 9 (z) - P, (z)) + ... 
was uniformly convergent in \z z \^e<r- By 249, 

F'W = P/W + (P,'W-P 1 ' (*)) + -... 

which implies that 

PiW-^F'W 

at every point in the circle. If at a particular point F(z) =J- 0, we 
have P B (z) =^ for each n, and hence by 41, 11, 



48 For the remainders of the latter scries only differ from those of 
the former in that they contain the common factor P m (*), which is a con- 
ttnuous function for every z in the circle \z * I SS i and hence is bounded 
in this closed circle.

this is precisely what our theorem asserts.

of most remarkable formulae.

also, by 128, 2, the numbers y n = (1 -|- -- -f- H -- j log n tend, as n > -f OO , 
to Euler's constant C, so that the right hand expression, which is 



when divided by n z , tends to a definite limit as n * + OO. This proves the 
statement. Further, the limit y K(*) say, becomes only for z = Q, 1, 
- 2, .... Excluding these values, we have, for all other values of z,

This function of a complex variables (restricted only to be ={= 0, ~1 , 2, . . .) 
s the so-called G a WHHI- function F(z) which we have already defined on 
p. 385 for real values of the argument. 

We proceed to show that K(z) is analytic in the whole plane (i. e. an 
integral function). For this, it suffices to show that the series

and the last factor in the preceding expression therefore remains << e b = ,4 3 , 
for every |^|<^ and every w;> w. Similarly the last factor but one (see p. 295), 
also remains less than a fixed number A 9 . As the remaining factor is also 
always less than a fixed number A for every \z\ fj #> it follows that

hand, the first m functions | g 1 (z) \ , | g. 2 (z) \ , . . ., | ^ OT U) | also remain bounded 
for every | z \ < g> ; the existence of the number A as asserted in the text is 
thus established. 

If z is restricted to lie in a circle , in the interior and on the boundar}' 
ot which s=^0, 1, 2, ... and | z \ < Q , then for every n > m

A. Dirichlet's series. 
A Dirichlet series is a scries of the form 52 



Here the terms as exponential functions are analytic in the 
whole plane. The chief question will therefore be to determine whether 
and where the series converges and, in particular, whether and where 
it converges uniformly. We have 

Theorem 1. To every Dirichlet series there corresponds a real 255, 
number X known as the abscissa of conrerf/ence of the series 
such that the series converges when $R (z) > A and diverges when >H ( z) < A . 
The number I may also be oo or +00; in the former case 
the series converges everywhere, in the latter nowhere. Further, if 
jl =|= -|- oo and X>h, the series is uniformly convergent in every 
circle of the half -plane $ft (z) ^> /' and accordingly the series, by Weier- 
strass 1 theorem 249, represents a function analytic and regular in every sucn 
circle and hence in the half-plane 63 W (z) > A. 

The proof follows a line of argument similar to that used in the 
case of power series (cf. 93) We first show that if the series con- 
verges at a point Z Q> it converges at every other point z for winch 
9t (z) > SR (* ). As however 



it suffices, by 184, 3 a, to show that the series

~- m ~ or of the form ^a n e~^ nZ , where the p n 's are positive numbers 



and the A n 's any real numbers increasing monotonely to -f oo. 

63 The existence of the half-plane of convergence was proved by /. L. W. V. 
Jensen (Tidskrift for Mathematik (5), Vol. 2, p. 63. 1884); the uniformity of the 
convergence and thereby the analytic character of the function represented 
were pointed out by E. Cohen (Annales fie. Norm. sup. (3), Vol. 11, p. 75. 1894;

tainly bounded, \ 8- B | < A, say. The th term of the above series is therefore 



and the series is accordingly convergent when ?R(z z )>0. 

As a corollary, we have the statement: If a Dirichlei series is 
divergent at a point z = z^ 9 it is divergent at every other point whose 
real part is less than that of z 1 . Supposing that a given Dirichlet 
series does not converge everywhere or nowhere, the existence of the 
limiting abscissa Jl is inferred (as in 93) as follows: Let z' be a 
point of divergence and z" a point of convergence of the series, and 

choose a? <SR(^) and y >5R(O> both real - For z = x o thc 
series will diverge, for z = y it will converge. Now apply the method 
of successive bisection, word for word as in 93, to the interval 
/ = x . . . y on the real axis. The value i so obtained will be the 
required abscissa. 

Now suppose X > i (for i = oo, A' may therefore be any real 
number); if z is restricted to lie in a domain G in which JR^^Jl' 
and |2|f^-R, so that in general G will take the shape of a seg- 
ment of a circle, our series is uniformly convergent in that domain. 
To show this, let us choose a point Z Q for which A< 3l(z Q )<A'; as 
before, we write 



54 More generally, we may at once observe that if |*| < - and \w\ < /?, 

Ct 

and if we write, taking the principal value, 



the factor &, which depends on z and w, remains less than a fixed constant 
for all the values allowed for z and w. Proof:

half- plane 9tf (z) > X) .

it follows at once that if a Dirichlet series converges absolutely at a 
point Z Q , it does so at any point z for which 9^(2) >SK(2 ), and if it 
does not converge absolutely at Z Q) then it cannot do so at any point 
z for which 9fi (z) < SR (Z Q ) . Just as before we obtain 

Theorem 2. There exists a definite real number I (which may 
also be +00 or oo) such that the Dirichlet series converges ab- 
solutely for $l(z)>l, but not for ft(z)<l. 

Of course we have A<^Z; over and above this, the relative posi- 
tions of the two straight lines $R (z) = Jl and jR (2) = / is subject to the 
following

Remarks and Examples. 

. 1. If a Dirichlet series is not merely everywhere or nowhere convergent the 

situation will in general be as follows, the half-plane *)t (z) < A of divergence of 
the series is followed by a strip A < $ft (z) < I of conditional convergence of the series; 
the breadth of this strip is in any case at most 1, and in the remaining half-plane 
$R (#) > /, the series converges absolutely. 

2. It may be shown by easy examples that the difference / A may assume 
any value between and 1 (both inclusive), and that the behaviour on the bounding 
lines 8t (z) = A and 9} (z) = / may vary in different cases.

function, regular in the half-plane fll (#) > 1. It is known as Riemann\ ^-function 
(v. 197, 2, 3) and is used in the analytical theory of numbers, on account of its 
connection with the distribution of prune numbers (see below, Rem. 9) 55 . 

5. Just as the radius of a power series can be deduced directly from its co- 
efficients (theorem 94), so we may infer from the coefficients of a given Dirichlet 
series what positions the two limiting straight lines occupy. We have the following 

Theorem. The abscissa of convergence A of the Dirichlet series 2 n z is invariably 
given by the formula 

_ j l 

A = lim log a u+l -f a^ 2 -f- . . . + a v

where x increases continuously and 

[eW] =w, 0*] =;. 

Substituting a n for a n in this formula, we obtain I, the limiting abscissa of absolute 
convergence 66 . 

0. A concise account of the most important results in the theory of Dinchlet's 
series may be found in G. H. Hardy and M. Riesz, Theory of Dirichlet's series, 
Cambridge 1915. 



65 A detailed investigation of this remarkable function (as well as of arbitrary 
Dirichlet series) is given by E. Landau y Handbuch der Lehre von der Verteilung der 
Primzahlen, Leipzig 1909, 2 Vols., in E. Landau, Vorlesungen uber Zahlentheorie, 
Leipzig 1927, 3 Vols., and in E. C. Titchmarsh, The Zeta-Function of Riemann, Cam- 
bridge 1930. 

56 As regards the proof, we must refer to a note by the author: "Uber die 
Abszisse der Grenzgeraden emer Dinchletschen Reihe" in the Sitzungsberichte der 
Berliner Mathematischen Gesellschaft (Vol. X, p. 2, 1910).

As an immediate consequence of Weierstrass' theorem on double scries, these neces- 
sarily cannot have a larger abscissa of convergence than the original series, and, 
owing to the additiopal factors log" n, they can obviously not have a smaller one 
either. They represent, in the interior of the half-plane of convergence, the derived 
functions F< v) (z). 

8. By 255, the function represented by a Dinchlet series can be expanded 
in a power series about any point interior to the half-plane of convergence as 
centre. The expansion itself is provided by Weierstrass' theorem on double

Proof. Let z be a definite point such that 5H (z) = 1 -f-<5 > 1 . By our 
remark 4 and 127, 7, the series and product certainly converge absolutely at 
this point. We have only to prove that they have the same value. Now 



multiplying these expansions together, for all prime numbers p< AT, _ whore 
AT denotes an integer kept fixed for the moment, the (finite) product so 
obtained is 



where the accent on the 2"* indicates that only some, and not all, of the terms 
of the series written down are taken. Here we have made use of the elemen- 
tary proposition that every natural number > 2 can be expressed in one and 
only one way as a product of powers of distinct primes (provided only positive

left out of account). Accordingly

On the right hand side \ve have the remainder of a convergent series, which 
tends to when N - + co. This proves the equality of the values of the 
infinite product and of the infinite series, as was required.

where 

H (1) = 1, M (2) = - 1, p (3) = - 1, p (4) = 0, p (5) - - 1, p (6) = + 1, . . . 
and generally /x (w) 0, + 1 , or 1 according as n is divisible by the square of 
a prime number, or is a product of an even number of primes, all different, or of 
an odd number of primes, all different. The product-expansion of the ^-function 
also shows that for JR (#) > 1, we always have (z) =t= 0. The curious coefficients 
fi (n) are known as Mobius* coefficients. There is no superficial regularity in the 
mode of succession of the values 0, -f- 1, 1 among the numbers /LI (n). 

11. Since f (z) - ^ converges absolutely for 81 (?)>!, we may form 

n z 

the square (f(*)) 2 by multiplying the series by itself term by term and re- 
arranging in order of increasing denominators (as is allowed by 91). We thus 
obtain 



where i n denotes the number of divisors of n. These examples may suffice 
to explain the importance of the - function in problems in the theory of 
numbers. 

B. Faculty series. 

A faculty series (of the first kind) is a scries of the form

which of course has a meaning only if 2 + 0, 1, 2, .... The 
questions of convergence, elucidated in the first instance by Jensen, 
are completely solved by the following 

258. Theorem of />/.rfu 67 . The faculty series (F) converges with 
the exclusion of the points 0, 1, 2, ... wherever the "asso- 
ciated" Dirichlet series ^ 



converges, and conversely the latter converges wherever the series (F) con- 
verges. The convergence is uniform in a circle for either series , when it 
is so for the other, 'provided the circle contains none of the points 
0, 1, 2, ... either in its interior or on its boundary.

58. Special classes of series of analytic functions. B. Faculty series. 447 

Proof. 1. We first show that the convergence of the Dirichlet 
series at any particular point =j= 0, 1, 2,... involves that of 
the faculty series at the same point. As 



>...(*+ n) n * g n (z)' 

if g n (z) has the same significance as in 1354, example 4, it is sufficient, 
by 184, 3 a, to show that the series 

n=l &(*) 8* + i(*) n =l I &W'& + i (*) I 
is convergent Now tends to a finite limit as w increases, namely 

Sn (2) 

t> the value F(z); hence, in particular, this factor remains bounded for 
all values of w (z being fixed). Hence it suffices to establish the con* 
verge nee of the series 



But this has been done already in 254, example 4. 

2. The fact that the convergence of the faculty series at any 
point invoK es that of the Dirichlet series follows in precisely the same 
manner, as again, by 184, 3 a, everything turns on the convergence of 

-!&,(*) -ft,+il- 

3. Now let be a circle in which the Dirichlet series converges 
absolutely and which contains none of the points 0, 1, 2, . . ., 
either as interior or boundary points. We have to show that the 
faculty scries also converges uniformly in that circle. By 198, 3 a, 
this again reduces to proving that 



a fg\.a (z 

Bn \ z ) * Sn + 1 \*. 

is uniformly convergent in $ and that the functions 1 / g n (z) remain 
uniformly bounded in . The uniform convergence of 



n=l 

was already established in 254, 4. Also it was shown on p. 440, 
footnote 51, that there exists a constant A' such that 

1 



for every z in Jf and every w. This is all that is required. (Cf. -H>, 
theorem 3.) 

4. The converse, that the Dirichlet series converges uniformly in 
every circle in which the faculty scries does so, follows at once by 
198, 3 a from the uniform convergence of the series 2 \ g n + ,() g n (2) | 
and the uniform boundedness of the functions g n (z) in the circle, both 
of which were established in 254, 4.

C. Lambert's series. 
A Lambert series is a series of the form 58 



If we again inquire what is the precise region of convergence of the 
series, it must first be noted that for every z for which z n 1 can 
be equal to zero, an infinite number of the terms of the series be- 
come meaningless. For this reason, the circumference of the unit circle 
will be entirely excluded from consideration 59 while we discuss the 

68 A more extensive treatment of this type of series is to be found in a paper 
by the author: Cber Lambertsche Reihen. Journ. f. d. reine u. angew. Mathem., 
Vol. 142, pp. 283315. 1913. 

59 This does not imply that this series may not converge at some points ar t 
of this circumference, for which zf =t= -f 1 for every n *Z 1. This may actually 
happen; but we will not consider the case here. 



58 Special classes of series of analytic functions. C. Lambert's series. 449 

question of convergence of these series, and the points inside and 
outside the circle will be examined separately. We have the following 
theorem, which completely solves the question of convergence in 
this respect: 

Theorem. // 2a n converges, the Lambert series converges for every z 259. 
whose modulus is 4 s ! W ^ a n * s n t convergent, the Lambert series 
converges at precisely the same points as the "associated" power 
series a n z n provided \ z \ + 1 as before. 

Further, the convergence is uniform in every circle & which lies 
completely (circumference included} within one of the regions of convergence 
of the series and contains no point of modulus 1. 

Proof. 1. Suppose 2a n divergent. The radius r of 2 a n z n is 
in that case necessarily <^ 1 and we have to show first that the Lambert 
series and the assoaated power series converge and diverge together 
for every \z\ < 1, and that the Lambert series diverges for \z\ > 1. 

Now y w = y z " .(\ n \ 

and vi ** v-. n 1 



Accordingly, it suffices, by 184, 3 a, to establish the convergence of 
the two series 



and 

I 7* I 

- M _ L V I* I 



for |s|<l. The first of these facts is obvious, however, while the 
second follows from the remark that for | z \ < 1, we have 1 1 z n \ > -x- 

for all sufficiently large w's. 

On the other hand, if the Lambert series converged at a point z v 
where | Z Q | > 1 , the power series 



would converge for z = 2 , and by 93, theorem 1, would have also 
to converge for z = + 1. Hence the series 



would also have to converge, which is contrary to hypothesis. 

Finally, the fact that the Lambert series converges uniformly in 
\z\ <* Q <. r may at once be inferred from the corresponding fact in 
the case of the power series \a n z n \, by 46,2, in virtue of the 
inequality 



450 Chapter XII. Series of complex terms. 



The case where 2a n diverges is thus completely dealt with. 

2. Now suppose a n convergent, so that 2 a n z n has a radius 
?^> 1. The Lambert series is certainly convergent for every | z \ -< 1 and 
indeed uniformly so for all values of z such that | z \ <^ > < ! 

For I z I ^> Q f > 1 , we have 



and as I 



.-6T-, 

"!_(!)' 



z 



' < 1, this reduces the later assertions to the pre- 
ceding ones, and the theorem is therefore established in all its parts. 
By the above, a very simple connection exists, in the case where 
_T a n is com ergent, between the sum of the series at a point z 

outside the unit circle and the same sum at the point inside it. 

Accordingly it will suffice if we consider only thdt region of 
convergence of the series which lies inside the unit circle. This is 
either the circle | z \ < ? or the unit circle | z \ < 1 itself, according as 
the radius r of the series 2 a n z n is < 1 or ^> 1. Let r 1 denote the 
radius of this perfectly definite region of convergence. 

The terms of a Lambert series are analytic functions regular in 
l^l^fj, and for e\ery positive Q <: r lf the series is uniformly con- 
vergent in | z \ <LQ'- hence we may apply Weierstrass* theorem on double 
series to obtain the expansion in power series of the function re- 
presented by a Lambert series m | z \ < r . We have 



+ a a ** + a,2 + 



and we may add all these series together term by term. In the th 
row, a given power z n will occur if, and only if, n is a multiple of k, 
or k a divisor of n. Therefore A n , the coefficient of z n in the result- 
ing series, will be equal to the sum of those coefficients a v whose 
suffix r is a divisor of n (including 1 or w). This we write sym- 
bolically 60 

A n = a d , 

d/n 

and we then have, for | z \ < r l , 



In words: the sum of all a d 's for which d is a divisor of n.

= z -}- 2 z* + 2 as 3 -f 3 s 4 + 2 # 5 + 4 z* -f 2 3 7 -f 4 z* -f . . . . 

In this curious power series, the terms # n whose exponents are prime numbers are 
distinguished by the coefficient 2. It was due to the misleadmgly close connection 
between this special Lambert series and the problem of primes that this series (as 
a rule called simply the Lambert series) 61 played a considerable part in the earlier 
attempts to deal with this problem. But nothing of importance was obtained in 
this manner for some time. Only quite recently AT. Wiener 62 succeeded by this means 
in proving the famous prime number theorem. 

2. a n = n. Here A n is equal to the sum of all the divisors of n, which we 
will denote by r n '. Thus for | z \ < 1

We then have in fact 



where /i (k) denotes the Mobtui coefficients defined in 257, example 10, whose 
values are 0, -|- 1 and 1. In consequence of this fact, not only can a Lambert 
series always be expanded in a power series, but conversely every power series 
may be expressed as a Lambert series, provided it vanishes for z = 0, i. e. A - 0. 
But it should be observed that a relation of the form 



need not remain true for | 3 \ > 1, even when both series converge there.

Divergent series. 

59. General remarks on divergent sequences and the 
processes of limitation. 

The conception of the nature of infinite sequences which we have 
set forth in all the preceding pages, and especially in 8 11, is of 
compai ativdy recent date; for a strict and irreproachable construction 
of the theory could not be attempted until the concept of the real 
number had been made clear. But even if this concept and any one 
general convergence test for sequences of numbers, say our second main 
criterion, were recognized without proof as practically axiomatic, it 
nevertheless remains true that the theory of the convergence of infinite 
sequences, and of infinite series in particular, is far more recent than 
the extensive use of these sequences and series, and the discovery of 
the most elegant results of the subject, e. g. by Euler and his con- 
temporaries, or even earlier, by Leibniz, Newton and their contem 
poraries. To these mathematician?, infinite series appeared in a very 
natural way as the result of calculation, and forced themselves into 
notice, so to speak : e. g. the geometric series 1 -\- x -\- x* -\- oc- 
curred as the non-terminating result of the division l/(l x); Taylor's 
series, and with it almost all the series of Chapter VI, resulted from 
the principle of equating coefficients or from geometrical considerations. 
It was in a similar manner that infinite products, continued fractions 
and all other approximation processes occurred. In our exposition, 
the symbol for infinite sequences was created and then worked with; 
it was not so originally, these sequences were there, and the question 
was, what could be done with them. 

On this account, problems of convergence in the modern sense 
were at first remote from the minds of these mathematicians 1 . Thus 
it is not to be wondered at that Euler, for instance, uses the geometric 
series 



i-y-^x-f-*/ -, \ X 

even lor x = 1 or x = 2, so that he unhesitatingly writes 2

and a great deal more. It is true that most mathematicians of those times 
held themselves aloof from such results in instinctive mistrust, and recog- 
nized only those which are true in the present-day sense 3 . But they had 
no clear insight into the reasons why one type of result should be admitted, 
and not the other. 

Here we have no space to enter into the very instructive discussions 
on this point among the mathematicians of the 17 th and 18 th centuries 4 . 
We must be content with stating, e. g. as regards infinite series, that Euler 
always let these stand when they occurred naturally by expanding an 
analytical expression which itself possessed a definite value 5 . This value 
was then in every case regarded as the sum of the series. 

It is clear that this convention has no precise basis. Even though, 

for instance, the series 1 1 + 1 1 H ... results in a very simple 

manner from the division 1/(1 x) for x 1 (see above), and there- 
fore should be equated to ^ there is no reason why the same series should 

not result from quite different analytical expressions and why, in view 
of these other methods of deducing it, it should not be given a different 
value. The above series may actually be obtained, for x = 0, from the 
function f(x) represented for every x > by the Dirichlet series 

f(*\ = J? ir-J)-" 1 = i_L4_!_!-L 

J{) -l "* 2*t-3- 4* -*-' 



or from t + 

putting x = 1. In view of this latter method of deduction, we should have 

2 

to take 1 1 + . . . = g, and in the case of the former there is no im- 
mediate evidence what value /(O) may have; it need not at any rate be + - .

3 Thus d'Alembert says (Opusc. Mathem., Vol. 5, 1768, 35; M^moire, p. 183): 
"Pour moi, j'avoue que tous les raisonnements et les calculs fond^s sur des series 
qui ne sont pas convergentes ou qu'on peut supposer ne pas 1'fitrc, me paraitront 
toujours tr&s suspects". 

4 For details, see R. Reiff, loc. cit. 

5 In a letter to Goldbach (7. VIII. 1745) he definitely says: ". . . so habe ich 
diese neue Definition der Summe einer jeglichen seriei gegeben: Summa cujusque 
seriei est valor expressions illius finitae, ex cujus evolutione ilia series oritur". 



59. General remarks on divergent sequences. 459 

Eulers principle is therefore insecure in any case, and it was 
only Enter* unusual instinct for what is mathematically correct which 
in general saved him from false conclusions in spite of the copious 
use \vhich he made of divergent series of ihis type 6 . Cauchy and 
Abel were the first to make the concept of convergence clear, and to 
renounce the use of any non-convergent series; Cauchy in his Analyse 
algebrique (1821), and Abel in his paper on the binomial series (1826), 
which is expressly based on Cauchy s treatise. At first both hesitated to 
take this decisive step 7 , but finally resolved to do so, as it seemed 
unavoidable if their reasoning were to be made strict and free from gaps. 

We are now in a position to survey the problem from above, as it 
were; and the matter at once becomes clear when we remember that 
the symbol for an infinite sequence of numbers in whatever form it 
is given, sequence, series, product or otherwise has, and can have, 
no meaning whatever in itself) but that a meaning was only assigned 
to it by us, by an arbitrary convention. This convention consisted 
firstly in allowing only convergent sequences, i. e. sequences whose 
terms approached a definite and unique number in an absolutely de- 
finite sense; secondly, it consisted in associating this number with the 
infinite sequence, as its value, or in regarding the sequence as no 
more than another symbol (cf 41, 1) for the number. However ob- 
vious and natural this definition may be, and however closely it may 
be connected with the way in which sequences occur (e. g. as suc- 
cessive approximations to a result which cannot be obtained directly), 
a definition of this kind must ne\ ertheless in all circumstances be con- 
sidered as an arbitrary one, and it might even be replaced by quite 
different definitions. Suitability and success are the only factors which 
can determine whether one or the other definition is to be preferred; 
in the nature of the thing itself, that is to say, in the symbol (s w ) of 
an infinite sequence 8 , there is nothing which necessitates any preference. 

We are therefore quite justified in asking whether the compli- 
cation which our theory exhibits (in parts at least) may not be due 



6 Cf. on the other hand p. 133, footnote 6. 

7 So far as Cauchy is concerned, cf. the preface to his Analyse algibrique, 
in which, among other things, he says: "Je me suis vu force d'admettre plusieurs 
propositions qui paraitront peut-ctre un peu dures, par exemple qu'une serie diver- 
gente n'a pas de somme". As regards Abel, cf. his letter to Holmboe (16. I. 1826) f 
in which he says: "Les series divergentes sont, en general, quelque chose de bien 
fatal, et c'est une honte qu'on ose y fonder aucune demonstration". As already 
mentioned (p. 458, footnote 3), J. d'Alembert had expressed himself in a similar 
sense as early as 1768. 

8 (s n ) may be assumed to be any given sequence of numbers, in particular, 
therefore, the partial sums of an infinite series 27 a n or the partial products of an 
infinite product. We use the letter s, with its reminder of the word "sum", because 
infinite series are by far the most important means of defining sequences. 



460 Chapter XIIT. Divergent series. 

to our interpretation of the symbol (s n ), as the limit of the sequence, 
assumed convergent, being an unfavourable one, however obvious 
and ready- to-hand it may appear. Other conventions might be drawn 
up in all sorts of ways, among which more suitable ones might per- 
haps be found. From this point of view, the general problem which 
presents itself is as follows: A particular sequence (s w ) is defined in 
some way, either by direct indication of the terms, or by a series or 
product, or otherwise. Is it possible to associate a "value" s with it, 
in a reasonable way? 

"In a reasonable way" might perhaps be taken to mean that the 
number s is obtained by a process closely connected with the previous 
concept of convergence, that is to say, with the formation of lims w s. 
This has been found so extraordinarily efficacious in all the preceding 
that we will not depart from it to any considerable extent without 
good reasons. 

"In a reasonable way" might also, on the other hand, be inter- 
preted as meaning that the sequence (s n ) is to have such a value s 
associated with it that wherever this sequence may occur as the final 
result of a calculation, this final result shall always, or at least usually, 
be put equal to s. 

Let us first illustrate these general statements by an example. 
The series 
5862. 2:(-l)" = l-l+l-l+-..., 

i. e. the geometric series 2x n for x = 1, or the sequence 
(sjel, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, ..., 

has so far been rejected as divergent, because its terms s n do not 
approach a single definite number. On the contrary, they oscillate 
unceasingly between 1 and 0. This very fact, however, suggests the 
idea of forming the arithmetic means 



c 9 

S n 



Since S|| = ~ [1 + ( l) n ], we find that 

i + C- p.] 



' 



~"~ 2 (n + 1) 2 ' 4 (n + 1) ' 

so that s n f (in the former sense) approaches the value -^ : 



By this very obvious process of taking the arithmetic mean, we 
have accordingly managed, in a perfectly accurate way, to give a 

meaning to Euler's paradoxical equation 11 + 1 -- [-... = --., to 



59. General remarks on divergent sequences. 461 

associate with the series on the left hand side the number ^ as its 

LI 

"value", or to obtain this number from the series. Whether we can 
always equate the final result of a calculation to whenever it ap- 

Ct 

pears in the foim (- l) n , cannot of course be determined off-hand. 

In the case of the expansion ^ --- = 2x n for x = 1, it is certainly 

i ~~ x 

/ _ j\n 1 

so; in the case of - - ~ for x = 0, it is equally true, as may 

be shown by fairly bimple means (cf. Exercise 200); and a great 
deal more evidence can be adduced to show that the association of 

the sequence 1, 0, 1,0, 1, ... with the value obtained in the manner 

Lt 

described above is "reasonable" 9 . 

We might therefore, as an experiment, make the following de- 
finition. If, and only if, the numbers 

c ' __ S Q + *i -f ... + * , __ , 9 . 

s n -- ---- ~ ~~ ' " 



tend to a limit s in the previous sense, the sequence (S M ), or series 
2 a n > will be said to "converge" to the "limit", or "sum", s. 

The suitability of this new definition has already been demon- 
strated in connection with the series 2( l) n , which now becomes 

convergent "in the new sense", with the sum -=-, which seems 

j 

thoroughly reasonable. Two further remarks will illustrate the ad- 
vantages of this new definition: 

1. Every sequence (s n ), convergent in the former sense and of 
limit s, is so constituted, in virtue of Cauchy's theorem 43, 2, that 
it would also have to be called convergent "in the new sense", with 
the same limit s. The new definition would therefore enable us to 
accomplish at least all that we could do with the former, while the 
example of the series -Z*( l) n shows that the new definition is more 
far-reaching than the old one. 

2. If two series, convergent in the old sense, -2*0 n = A and 
2b n = B, are multiplied together by Cauchys rule, giving the series 
2c n E 2(a Q b n + !&-.! H ----- t-0 n fy))> we k now tli at mis series is 
not necessarily convergent (in the old sense). And the question when 
c n does converge presents very considerable difficulties and has not 
been satisfactorily cleared up so far. The second proof of theorem 189, 



9 From the series (see above) for - - - ^ also we can accordingly de- 



2 

duce the value ~ for x = 1 . We have only to observe that the series, written 

o 

somewhat more carefully, is 1 4- 0-a; x- -\- X 9 + 0# l a; 5 -f--l -- , and is 
therefore l + O l + l + O l+H ----- for a; = J f 



4:62 Chapter XIII. Divergent series, 

however, shows that in every case 



if C n denotes the n th partial sum of 2c n . The meaning of this is 
that <Sc n always converges in the new sense, with the sum AB. Here 
the advantage of the new convention is obvious: A situation which, 
owing to the insuperable difficulties involved, it was impossible to 
clear up as long as we kept to the old concept of convergence, may 
be dealt with exhaustively in a very simple way, by introducing a 
slightly more general concept of convergence. 

We shall very soon become acquainted with other investigations 
of this kind (see 61 in particular); first of all, however, we shall 
make some definitions relating to several fundamental matters: 

Besides the formation of the arithmetic mean, we shall become 
acquainted with quite a number of other processes, which may with 
success be substituted for the former concept of convergence, for the 
purpose of associating a number s with a sequence of numbers (s n ). 
These processes have to be distinguished from one another by suitable 
designations. In so doing it is advisable to proceed as follows: The 
former concept of convergence was so natural, and has stood the test 
so well, that it ought to have a special name reserved for it. Accor- 
dingly, the expression: "convergence of an infinite sequence (scries, 
product, . . .)" shall continue to mean exactly what it did before. If 
by means of new rules, as, for instance, by the formation of the arithmetic 
mean described above, a number s is associated with a sequence (s n ), 
we shall say that the sequence (s n ) is limitable* by that process, and 
that the corresponding series 2a^ is summable by the process, and 
we shall call s the value of either (or in the case of the series, its 
sum also). 

When, however, as will occur directly, we are making use of 
several processes of this kind, we distinguish these by attached initials 
A, B, . . ., F, . . ., and speak for instance of a F- process 10 . We shall say 
that the sequence (s n ) is limitable F, and that the series 2a n is summ 
able F; and the number 5 will be referred to as the Flimit of the 
sequence or Fsum of the series; symbolically 

F-lim s n == s, V-2a n = s . 
When there is no fear of misunderstanding, we may also express the 



* German: hmitierbav. 

10 In the case of the concept of integrability the situation is somewhat 
similar and it was prob.ibly in this connection that the above type of notation 
was first introduced. 'Ihus we say a function is integrable /? or integrable L 
according as we are referring* to integrability in Riemann's or in Lebesgtte's 
sense. 



50. General remarks on divergent sequences, 463 

former of the two statements by the symbolism 



which more precisely implies that the new sequence deduced from (s n ) by 
the F-process converges to s. 

When, as will usually be the case in what follows, the process admits 
of a &-fold iteration, or can be graded into different orders, we attach a 
suffix and speak of a V ^-limitation process, a V ^-summation process, etc. 

In the construction and choice of such processes we shall of course 263. 
not proceed quite arbitrarily, but we shall rather let ourselves be guided 
by questions of suitability. We must give the first place to the fundamental 
stipulation to be made in this connection, namely that the new definition 
must not contradict the old one. We accordingly stipulate that any F- 
proccss which may be introduced must satisfy the following permanence 
condition : 

I. Every sequence (s n ) convergent in the former sense, with the limit s, 
must be limitable V with the value s. Or in other words, lim s n = s must 
in every case imply u F-lim s n s. 

In order that the introduction of a process of this kind may not 
be superfluous, we further stipulate that the following extension con- 
dition is to hold: 

II. At least one sequence (sj, which diverges in the former sense, 
must be limitable by the new process. 

Let us call the totality of sequences which are limitable by a 
particular process the range of action of this process. The condition II 
implies that only those processes will be allowed which possess a 
wider range of action than the ordinary process of convergence. It 
is precisely the limitation of formerly divergent sequences and the 
summation of formerly divergent series which will naturally claim the 
greater part of our attention now. 

Finally, if several processes are employed together, say a V- process 
and a HP- process simultaneously, we should be in danger of hopeless 
confusion if we did not also stipulate that the following compatibility 
condition should be fulfilled: 

III. // one and the same sequence (s n ) is limitable by two different 
processes, simultaneously applied, then it must have the same value 
by both processes. In other words, we must in every case have 

= W'\ims n , if both these values exist. 



11 We might also be satisfied if some convergent sequences at least are 
limitable with unaltered value by the process considered. This is the case e. g 
with the E f - process discussed further on, provided the sutfix p is complex 



464 Chapter X11I. Divergent series. 

We shall only consider processes which satisfy these three con 
ditions. Besides these, however, we require some indication whether 
the association of a value 5 with the sequence (sj effected by a parti- 
cular V- process is a reasonable one in the sense explained above 
(p. 460). Here widely -varying conditions may be laid down, and the 
processes which are in current use are of very varied degrees of ef- 
ficiency in this respect. In the first instance we should no doubt require 
that the elementary rules of the algebra of convergent sequences (v. 8) 
should as far as possible be maintained, i. e. the rules for term-by-term 
addition and subtraction of two sequences, term-by-term addition of a 
constant, and term-by-term multiplication by a constant, and the effect of 
a finite number of alterations (27, 4), etc. Next we might perhaps 
require that if, say, a divergent series 2a n has associated with it the 
value s, and if this series is deduced, e. g. from a power series 
f(x) = 2c n x n by substituting a special value X L for x, then the number 5 
should bear an appropriate relation to f(x^) or to Mmf(x) for x^x^\ 
and similarly for other types of series (Dirichlet series, Fourier series etc.). 
In short, we should require that wherever this series appears as the final 
result of a calculation, the result should be s. The greater the 
number of conditions similar to the above which are satisfied by a 
264. particular process let us call them the conditions F, without taking 
pains to formulate them with absolute precision and at the same 
time, the greater the range of action of the process, the greater will 
be its usefulness and value from our point of view. 

We proceed to indicate a few of these processes of limitation 
which have proved their worth in some way or another. 

205. v 1. The C r , H^ 9 or Af-process 12 . As described above, 262, we 
form the arithmetic means of the terms of a sequence (s n ): 



0.1.2,...) 



which we will denote by c n \ h n ', or m n . If these tend to a limit s in 
the older sense, when n -> oo, we say that (s n ) is limit able C or 
limitable H l or limit able Af with the value s and we write 

Af-lim s n = s or M (s n ) 



or use the letters C x or H^ instead of M. The series Z a n with the partial 
sums s n will be called summable C l or summable H l or 
summable Af, and s will be called its C^-, //!-, or M-sum. 

The sequence of units 1, 1, 1, ... may be considered to be the 
simplest convergent sequence we can conceive. The process described 
above consists in comparing, on the average, the terms s n of the sequence 



18 The choice of the letters C and H is explained in the two next sub-sections. 



59 General remarks on divergent sequences. 465 

under consideration with those of the sequence of units: 

- ' = 1. ' = __ o + Si -f- . . + s n 
c n - n n w. n j + j + _ ^ + r . 

This "averaged" comparison of (sj with the unit sequence will be met 
with again in the case of ihe following processes. 

The usefulness of this process has already been illustrated above 
by several examples. We have also seen that it satisfies the two con- 
ditions 263, I and II, and 111 does not come under consideration at 
the moment. In 60 and 61 it will further be seen that the con- 
ditions F (264) are also in wide measure fulfilled. 

2. irolder's process, or the H p - process 13 . If with a given 
sequence (s n ), we proceed from the arithmetic means h n f just formed 
to their mean 



and if the sequence (h n ") has a limit in the ordinary sense, lim h n " = $, 
we say that 14 the sequence s n is limitable Jf 2 with the value s. 

By 43, 2, every sequence which is limitable H^ (and therefore 
also every convergent sequence), is also limitable H^, with the same 
value. The new process therefore satisfies the conditions 263, I, II and 
III; moreover, its range is wider ihan that of the ^-process, for 
the series 



=o 

for instance, is summable // 2 with the sum .-, but not summable 
HI nor convergent. In fact, we have here 

and 

(h n ') == 1, 0, ~, 0, j! , 0, .... 

These sequences arc not convergent. On the other hand, the numbers 
h n " *~T as i s easily calculated. This is precisely the value which 
one would expect from 

1 \ 9 n 

' n=0 
for x = 1. 



13 Holder, O.i Grenzwerte von Reihen an der Konvergenzgrenze. Math. 
Ann., Vol. 20, pp. 535549. 1882. Here arithmetic means of the kind described 
are for the first time introduced for a special purpose. 

14 The rest of the notation is formed in the same way, // d -lim $ n = s, 
H % -2a n = s, // 3 (s n )-+.s, etc. but hereafter we shall not mention it specially. 



466 Chapter XIII. Divergent series. 

If the numbers h n " do not tend to a unique limit, we proceed to 
take their mean 

/, " I J, " 1 Z, // 

h '" "*" * ~*~ ' * ' " n Cfi 1 2 * 

"n w + 1 * ' ' ' " * *' 

or, in general, for 15 /> ^ 2, the mean 



,,.... 

between the numbers /* ""^ obtained at the previous stage; if these new 
numbers A^ -> $, for some definite />, we say that the sequence (s n ) is 
litnitable H v with the value s. 

It is easy to form sequences which are limitable H 9 for any particular 
given p, but for no smaller value of p than this 16 . This, together with 
43, 2, shows that the /^-processes not only satisfy the conditions 263, 
I III, but that their range of action is wider for each fixed p ^ 2 than 
for all smaller values of p. As regards the conditions F, we must again 
cfer to 60 and 61. 

3. Cesaro's process, or the C^-process 17 . We first write 
n ='S^ Q \ and also, for each k ^ 1, 



and we now examine the sequence of numbers 18 



,<*- 





for each fixed k. If, for some value of k, c^ -> 5, we say that the sequence 
(s n ) is limitable C k with the value s. 

In the case of the //-process, we cannot obtain simple formulae giving 
h^ directly in terms of s n , for larger values of p. In the case of the C-process, 
this is easily done, for we have 

(*) _ n + k - 1\ , fn + k - 2\ /* - 1\ 

- > + \ k-i y *i ' U - 1/ Jm 



15 Or indeed for p ^ 1, provided we agree to put h 0) = s n and take the H Q - 
process to be ordinary convergence, as we shall do here and in all analogous cases 
in future. 

16 Write, for instance, (^ 1> ~ 1) ) = 1, 0, 1,0, 1, ... and work backwards to the 
values of s n . Other examples will be found in the following sections. 

17 Cesdro, E.i Sur la multiplication des series. Bull, des sciences math. (2), 
Vol. 14, pp. 114120. 1890. 

18 The denominators of the right hand side are exactly the values of S 
obtained by starting with the sequence (s n ) == 1, 1, 1, . . . , i. e. they indicate how 
many of the partial sums s v are comprised in S. Thus the C fc -process again in- 
volves an "averaged" comparison between a given sequence (s n ) and the unit 
sequence. 



59. General remarks on divergent sequences. 467 

or if we wish to go back to the scries -i'a n , with the partial sums s n , 



This may be proved quite easily by induction, or by noticing that, 
by 102, 



n=o n=o 

so that for every integral k 




(i-xy~- n =o 
whence, by 108, the truth of the statement follows 19 . 

In the following sections we shall enter in detail into this process 
also, which becomes identical with the preceding one (h n ' = c n ') for 

^ 4. AbeVs process, or the A -process. Given a series 2a n with 
the partial sums s n , we consider the power series 



If its ladius is ^> 1, and if (for real values of x) the limit 
lim 2a n x n = lim (1 x) 2s n x n = s 

a;->l-0 ->l-0 

exists, we say that the series 2Ja n is 2Q summable A, and that tlis 
sequence (s n ) is limit able A 9 with the value s\ in symbols: 

A-2a n = s, A-\ims n = s. 

In consequence of Abel's theorem 100, this process also fulfils 
the permanence condition I, and simple examples show that it fulfils 
the "extension condition" II; for instance, in the case of the series 
2( l) n already used, the limit for x *1 



exists. Thus Euler's paiadoxical equation (p. 457) is again justified 

19 In view of these last formulae, it is fairly natural to allow non-integral values 
> 1 for the suffix k also. Such limitation processes of non-integral order were 
first consistently introduced and investigated by the author (Grenzwerte von Reihen 
bei der Annaherung an die Konvergenzgrenze, Inaug.-Diss., Berlin 1907). We 
shall however not enter into this question, either here in the case of the C-process, 
or later itfi that of the other processes considered. 



20 



If the product (1 x) 2s n x n is written in the form 



we see that it is again an "averaged" comparison of the given sequence with the 
unit sequence which is involved, though in a somewhat different manner. 



468 Chapter XIII. Divergent series. 

by this process. If we now use the more precise form 

x-^(-i)---J or c^c-iy-A. 

we thus indicate two perfectly definite processes by which the value 
- may be obtained from the series J?( l) w . 

5. Hitler's process, or the K- process. We saw in 144 that if 
the first of the two series 

oo c 

^(-l)-. and 

rt=0 &-- 

converges, then so does the second, and to the same sum. Simple 
examples show, however, that the second series may quite well con- 
verge without the first one doing so: 

1. If a n 2= 1, then a Q = 1 and A k a = for &I>1. Accordingly, 
the two series are 

1 1 + 1 H ----- and -L + O-fO + OH ---- 

the second of which converges to the sum - -. 

2. If, for M = 0, 1, 2, ..., 

a n == 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 
then 

Aa n = - 1, 1, 1, - 1, ..., 
and for k ^ 2 

A*a n = 0, 0, 0, 0, ---- 

Accordingly, the t\\o series are 

1_ 2 + 3-4 -\ ----- and - ~ + + -| ---- . 

the second of which converges to the sum -^ . 

3. Similarly for a n = (n + 1) 3 we find <40 = 7, /I a a =12, 
-d s a = 6, and, for &>3, zl fe a =0. The two series are thus 
1 _ 8 + 27 - 64 + ---- and \ - -J- + ?| - ^ + + + - - -, 

the second of which converges to the sum -- 5- . 

o 

4. For a n =2 n , A k a Q = ( 1)*. Thus the two series are: 

! _ 2 +4 - 8 H ----- and -L - A + 1 - -I H ----- , 

the second of which converges to the sum y i. e. the sum which we should 
expect for x = 2 from j- = Z x n . 

5. For a n =( l) n z n , d k a = (l + z) k . -The two series are therefore 



the second of which converges to the sum 1 _ , provided |j?+ l( < 2. 



59. General remarks on divergent sequences. 469 

If we start with any scries 2a n , without alternately ~f- and 
signs, the series 



will be an Eiders transformation of the given series, which we ma> 
also obtain as follows: The series 2 'a n results from the power series 
for x = \, hence from 



for y = . Expanding the latter in powers of y, before substituting 



y = - , we obtain Eulers transformation. In fact 



In order to adapt this process for use with any sequence (sj we write, 
deviating somewhat from the usual notation, 

o+ a iH ----- Hn-i = s n for w ^!> and So^ ' 
and also 

*o'-!-i'H ----- Mn-i = s n ' for w^l, and V^ - 
It is now easy to verify that 21 for cvvry n .2. 



We accordingly make the following definition: A sequence (s n ) is said 
to be limitable E\ with the value s, if the sequence (s n ') just de- 
fined tends 22 to s. If, without testing the convergence of (s n '), we write

L-o n-o 

Hence 



n=0 



whence the relation may at once be inferred. 

88 Here also the denominator 2" is obtained from the numerator 



by replacing: each of the s n 's by 1. Thus we are again concerned with an 
"averaged" comparison, of a definite kind, between the sequence (s n ) and the 
unit sequence.

and in general, for r ^> 1 ,

we shall similarly say that the sequence (s n ) is limitdble E r and 
regard s as its E r - limit, if, for a particular r, s^ >s. 

Our former theorem 144 (see also 44, 8) then shows in any 
case that this E- process satisfies the permanence condition I, and the 
examples given there show that the condition II is also satisfied. This 
process will be examined further in 63. 

6. JRfesz's process, or the Jf^- process 23 . For making the 
principle of averaged comparison of the sequence (s n ) with the unit 
sequence more powerful, a principle which, as we saw, lies at the 
basis of all the former limitation projesscs, a fairly obvious pro 
cedure consists in attributing arbitrary weights to the various terms s n . 
If /z , /x 1 , /z 2 , . . . denote any sequence of positive numbers, then

is a generalized mean of this kind. In the special case of /^ n -, 
we speak of a logarithmic mean. 

As with the //-, C-, or ^-processes, this generalized method of form- 
ing the mean may of course be repeated, writing, for instance, as in the 
C-process, 

>-, and ^=1, 

and then, for k ^ 1 ,

for n -> + oo. If these tend to a limit 5, we might say that (s n ) was 
Hmitable 24 R /Jk with the value s. This definition, however, is not 
in use. The process in question has reached its great importance only 
by being transformed into a form more readily amenable to analysis, as 



23 Riesz, M. : Sur les series de Dirichlet et les series entieres. Comptes rendus 
Vol. 149, pp. 909912. J909. 

24 Here we add a suffix /* to R k , the notation of the process, as a reference to 
the sequence (/i n ) used in the formation of the mean. For \JL U = 1, this process 
reduces exactly to the C^-process.

follows: A (complex) function s (t) of the real variable / ^ is defined by 
s(t) = s v in A^ < t^ A^ (1) (v = 0, 1, 2, . . . ; A^ = 0) 
with s(0) = 0; then 





and it is natural to substitute repeated integration for the repeated sum- 
mation used in the formation of the numbers cr^ and A*\ A A-ple in-

instead of a n (fc) . Similarly, instead of the numbers A n (ft) , we have to 
take the values which we obtain by putting s n = 1 in the integrals 
just written down, i. e. 



We should then have to deal with the limit (for fixed k) 
lim A 





If this limit exists and = s, the sequence (s w ) will be called limitdble 
-K** with the value s. 

Here we cannot enter into a more detailed examination of the 
question whether the two definitions given for the R^- process are 
really exactly equivalent, or into the elegant and far-reaching appli- 
cations of the process in the theory of Dirichlets series. (For refer- 
ences to the literature, see 266.) 

7. .Borel's process, or the /J- process. We have just seen how 
Riesz' process tends to increase the efficiency of the H- or C- pro- 
cesses, by substituting for the method of averaged comparison be- 
tween the sequence (s n ) and the unit sequence a more general form 
of this procedure. The range of Abel's process may be enlarged in 
a similar way by making use of other series instead of the geometric 
series there used for purposes of comparison. Taking the exponential 
series as a particular case, and accordingly considering the quotient 
of the two series

2s n X -, and 27 J.

25 The equality of the two sides is easily proved by induction, using inte- 
gration by parts.

that is to say, the product 

n=o n wl 

for x *4-oo> we obtain the process introduced by ZT. Borel 29 . In 
accordance with it we make the following definition: A sequence (s w ) 

x n 
such that the power series ^ s n converges everywhere and the 

function F(x) just defined tends to a unique limit s as # * -f" > 
will be called Hinitable B with the value s. 

In order to illustrate the process to some extent, let us first take 
2a n s= 2( l) n once more; then s n = 1 or 0, according as n is even 
or odd. Accordingly 

y i-L. + -4-.=^ e *+ e ~* 

and we have to deal with the limit

which is evidently -^ . Thus 2 ( l) n is summable B with the 

sum -jr . More generally, taking a n = z n > we have, provided only

This process also satisfies the permanence condition; for we have

in his Lecons sur les series divergentes, 2 nd ed., Paris 1928. 

27 By the C-processes, as shewn in 268, 8, the geometric series is summable, 
beyond | z \ < 1, only for the boundary points of the unit circle, -f- 1 excepted; 
by Enters process it is summable throughout the circle | z -f- 1 | < 2, which en- 
closes the unit circle, with a wide margin; by Borel's process it is summable in the 
whole half-plane 9ft (z) < 1, the value in this and the preceding cases being every- 

where . __ .

hand side is then in absolute value

for positive #'s. Now the product of e~ x and a polynomial of the w th 
degree tends to when x ~> + oo ; we can therefore choose so large 
that this product is < s for every x > . For these #'s the whole ex- 
pression is then < e in absolute value, and our statement is established. 
8. The J5 r -process. The range of the process just described is, in 
a certain sense, extended by substituting other series for 27*-,, in the first 
instance 27 >--y ( , say, where r is some fixed integer > 1. We accordingly 

say that a sequence (s n ) is limit able B r with the value s if the quotient 
of the two functions 

00 x rn rn ^i x rn 

27 s n 7^-. and 27 , %-:, i. e. the product r e~ x 2 s n 7 -^ 

n-O ( rn > ! n-o( rw > ! n-0 ( rw > 1 

tends to the limit s when # -> -j- oo . (We must, of course, assume again 
here that the first-named series is everywhere convergent.) Thus the 
fi-process, for instance, is quite useless for the sequence s n = ( l) n n !, 

since here s n x ^ = 27 ( l) n x n does not converge for every x\ whereas 

x rn 

the series 27 s n ( r, already converges everywhere 28 when we take r 2. 

9. Le jRoy's process. We have usually interpreted the limitation 
processes by saying that by means of them we carry out an "averaged" 
comparison between the given sequence (s n ) and the unit sequence 1, 1, 
1, ... We may look at the matter in a slightly different way. If the numbers 
s n are the partial sums of the series 27 a n> we have to examine, for instance 
in the C x -process, the limit of 

* + *i 4- . . . + s n 






Here the terms of the series appear multiplied by variable factors which 
reduce the given series to a finite sum, or at any rate to a series convergent 
in the old sense. By means of these factors, the influence of distant terms 
is destroyed or diminished; yet as n increases all the factors tend to 1 
and thus ultimately involve all the terms to their full extent. The situation 
is similar in the case of Abel's process, where we were concerned with 
the limit of 2a n x n for x -> 1 0; here the effect described above is 



28 This does not mean that the # r -process (r > 1) is more favourable than 
the B-process for every sequence (s n ). On the contrary, there are sequences that 
are hmitable B but not limitable B a . 



474 Chapter XIII. Divergent series. 

brought about by the factors x n , which, however, increase to 1 as x -> 1 0. 
This principle appears most clearly as the basis of the following process 29 : 
The series 



n=0 

is assumed convergent for ^ x < 1. If the function which it defines 
in that interval tends to a limit 5 as # >1 0, the series Sa n may 
be called summable R to the value s. 

This method is not so easily dealt with analytically, and for this 
reason it is of smaller importance. 

10. The most general form of the limitation processes. It will 
have been noticed that all the processes so far described belong es- 
sentially to two types: 

1. In the case of the first type, from a sequence (s n ), with the 
help of a matrix (cf. Toeplitz theorem 221) 

r=(<O 

a new sequence of numbers 

*' **o*o + *ii H ----- M ft 5 n + -"> (A = 0, 1, 2,...) 
is formed by combination of the sequence s , s^j..., s n , ... with the 
successive rows a k0 , a kl , ..., a fcw , . .. , the assumption being, of 
course, that the series on the right hand side represents a definite 
value, i. e. is convergent (in the old sense) 30 . The sequence S Q ', s x ', . . . , 
s h ', . . . will be called for short the T- transformation 31 of the sequence 
(s n ) and its n th term, when there is no fear of ambiguity, will be denoted 
by T (s n ). If the accented sequence (s k f ) is convergent with the 
limit s, the given sequence is said to be limit able T 'with the value s. In 
symbols : 

TMim s n = s or T(s w ) + s . 

29 Le Roy: Sur les series divergentes, Annalcs de la Fac. des sciences 
de Toulouse (2), Vol. 2, p. 317. 1900. 

* If each row of the matrix T contains only a finite number of terms, 
this condition is automatically fulfilled. This is the case with the processes 
1, 2, 3 and 5. 

31 The series 2 aj/ 9 of which the s k ft s are the partial sums, may similarly 
be called the T- transformation of the series 2 a n with the s n 's as its partial 
sums. Thus e. g. the series 



is the Cj- transformation of the series 2 a n . In this sense, all T-processes 
give more or less remarkable transformations of scries, which may very often 
he of use in numerical calculations. (This is particularly the case with the 
E -process). The transformation of the series may equally, of course, be re- 
garded as the primary process and the transformation of the sequence of partial 
sums may be deduced from it. Indeed it was in this way that we were led 
to the E- process. 



69. General remarks on divergent sequences. 475 

It is at once clear that the processes 1, 2, 3, 5, and the first one 
described in 6 belong to this type. They differ only in the choice of the 
matrix T. Theorem 221, 2 also immediately tells us with what matrices 
we are certain to obtain limitation processes satisfying the permanence 
condition 32 . 

2. In the case of the second type, we deduce from a sequence (s n ) 9 
by combining it with a sequence of functions 

(9w) = 9o (*)> 9i (*)> > 9n (*)> 9 
the function 

pi / M\ fn f*A\ O I / \ | I / \ | 

where we assume, say, that each of the functions <p n (x) is defined for every 
x > x and that the series Sy n (x)s n converges for each of these values 
of x. In that case F (x) is also defined for every x > # , and we may in- 
vestigate the existence of the limit lim F (x). If the limit exists and = s t 

x->+v> 

the sequence (s n ) will be called 33 limit able cp with the value s. 

By analogy with 221, 2, we shall at once be able to assign conditions 
under which a process of this type will satisfy the permanence condition. 
This will certainly be the case if a) for every fixed n, 

lim 9 n (x) - 0, 

if b) a constant K. exists such that 

I <Po(*) I + I <Pi (*) I + . + I <P (*) I < K. 
for every x > X Q and all rc's, and if c) for x -> + oo 

Km- 



It will be noticed that these conditions correspond exactly to the assump- 
tions 34 a), b) and c) of theorem 221, 2. The proof, which is quite analogous 
to that of this theorem, may therefore be left to the reader. 

Borers process evidently belongs to this type, with ep n (x) = e" x ^. 
The same may be said of Abel's process, if the interval . . . + oo 



32 The importance of theorem 221, 2 lies chiefly in the fact that the con- 
ditions a), b) and c) of the theorem are not merely sufficient, but actually necessary 
for its general validity. We cannot enter into the question (v. p. 74, footnote 19), 
but we may observe that in consequence of this fact, the T-processes whose matrix 
satisfies the conditions mentioned are the only ones which fulfil the permanence 
condition. 

33 In all essentials this is the scheme by means of which O. Perron (Beitrage 
zur Theorie der divergenten Reihen, Math. Zschr. Vol. 6, pp. 286 310. 1920) 
classifies all the summation processes. 

34 Like these they are not only sufficient, but also necessary for the general 
validity of the theorem. Further details in H. Raff, Lineare Transformationen bes- 
chrankter integrierbarer Funktionen, Math. Zeitschr, Vol. 41, pp. 605 629. 1930. 



476 Chapter XIII. Divergent series. 

is projected into the interval ... 1 which is used in the latter, that 
is, if the series (1 x) 2 s n x n is replaced by the series 



and the latter is examined for x+-{-oo. In an equally simple 
manner, it may be seen that Le Roy's process belongs to this type. 

The second type of limitation process contains the first as a par- 
ticular case, obtained when x assumes integral values ^ only 
dp n (k) ~ a kn) u ^ e mere ly use a continuous parameter in the one case, 
and a discontinuous one in the other. Conversely, in view of 19, 
def. 4 a, the continuous passage to the limit may be replaced by a 
discontinuous one, and hence the ^-processes may be exhibited as 
a sub-class of the T- processes. These remarks, however, are of little 
use: in further methods of investigation the two types of process 
nevertheless remain essentially different. 

It is not our intention to investigate all the processes which come 
under these two headings from the general points of view indicated 
above. Let us make only the following remarks. We have already 
pointed out what conditions the matiixTor sequence of functions (cp n ) 
must fulfil, in order that the limitation process based on it may satisfy 
the permanence condition 263, I. Whether the conditions 263, II 
and III are alo fulfi led, will depend on fuither hypotheses regarding 
the matrix T or sequence (9^,); this question is accordingly be t left 
to a separate investigation in each case. The question as to the ex- 
tent to which the conditions F (264) are fulfilled, cannot be attacked 
in a general way either, but must be specially examined for each 
process. One important property alone is con.mon to all the T- 
and (^-processes, namely their linear character: If two sequences (s n ) 
and (t n ) are limitable in accordance with one and the same process, 
the first with the value s, and the second with the value t, then the 
sequence (as n -{- bt n ), whatever the constants a and b maybe, is also 
limitable by the same process, with the value as-\-bt. The proof 
follows immediately from the way in which the process is constructed. 
Owing to this theorem, all the simplest rules of the algebra of con- 
vergent sequences (term-by-term addition of a constant, term-by-term 
multiplication by a constant, term-by term addition or subtraction of 
two sequences) remain formally unaltered. On the oth^r hand, we must 
expressly emphasize the fact that the theorem on the influence of a 
finite number of alterations (42, 7) doe> not necessarily remain valid 35 . 



35 For this, the following simple example relating to the B-process was first 
given by G. H. Hardy: Let s n be defined by the expansion 

00 x n 
sin(e*) = H s n . 

n-Q n '

59. General remarks on divergent sequences. 477 

If we wished to give a general and fairly complete survey of the 
present state of the theory of divergent series, we should now be 
obliged to enter into a more detailed investigation of the processes which 
we have described. To begin with, we should have to deal with the 
questions whether, and to what extent, the individual processes do 
actually satisfy the stipulations 2G3, II, III and 264; we should have 
to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a series to be summable 
by a particular process; we should have to find the relations between 
the ways in which the various processes act, and go further into the 
questions indicated in No. 10, etc. Owing to lack of space it is of 
course out of the question to investigate all this in detail. We must be 
content with examining a few of the processes more particulary; 
we choose the H-, C-, A-, and E- processes. At the same time we 
will so arrange the choice of subjects that as far as possible all 
questions and all methods of proof which play a part in the com- 
plete theory may at least be indicated. 

For the rest we must refer to the original papers, of which we may men-

60 The C- and /^-processes. 

Of all the summation processes briefly sketched in the preceding 
section, the C- and /^-processes and especially the process of limitation 
by arithmetic means of the first order, which is the same in both arc 
distinguished by their great simplicity; they have, moreover, proved of 
great importance in the most diverse applications. We shall accordingly 
first examine these processes in somewhat greater detail. 

267. In the case of the //-process, Cauchy's theorem 43, 2 shows that, 
for p ^ 1, h^~ 1 ^ -> s implies 3e h^ -> s, so that the range of the //^-process 
contains that of the //p. ^process. The corresponding fact holds in the 
case of the C-process: 

Theorem 1. If a sequence is limitable C k ^ l with the value s t (k ^ 1), 
it is also limitable C k with the same value. In symbols: From *~ 
it follows that c ( -> s. (Permanence theorem for the C-process.) 



36 Cf. p. 466, footnote 15. By the Oth degree of a transformation, higher 
degrees of which are introduced, we mean the original sequence.

Proof. By definition (v. 265, 3)

whence by 44, 2 the statement immediately follows. 

Accordingly, to every sequence which is limitable C , for some 
suitable suffix p, there corresponds a definite integer k such that the 
sequence is limitable C fc but is not limitable C fc-1 . (If the sequence 
is convergent from the first, we of course take k = 0.) We then say 
that the sequence is exactly limitable C ft .

The fact of the summability indeed follows directly from Example 2. For the

linear character of our process (v. p. 476), that the series, obtained from 2^

of the explicit foimulae for S^ and GJf\ given in 265,3, to which there is

Since the //-process outwardly seems to bear a certain relationship 
to the C-process, it is natural to ask whether their effects are distinguish- 
able or not. We shall see that the two ranges of action coincide completely.

Many proofs have been given for this theorem 42 , among which that 
of Schur 43 is probably the clearest and best adapted to the nature of the

problem. Combined with a skilful artifice of A. F. Andersen 44 , the proof 
becomes particularly simple. 

We next show that the equivalence theorem is contained in the fol- 
lowing theorem, simpler in appearance: 

270. Theorem 2a. If (z n ), for k ^ 1, is limitable C k with the value , the 

sequence 270 of the arithmetic means z n ' = -O-i^ 1 + _ :JL+_^ 
able C k _ l with the value , and conversely. 
By this theorem, each of the k relations 



is in fact a consequence of any of the others; in particular, the first is a 
consequence of the last. But that is what the equivalence theorem states. 
It suffices, therefore, to prove Theorem 2 a. But this follows immedi- 
ately from the two relations connecting the C K - and C^^-transformations 
of the sequence (z n ) with those of the sequence (z n ') y viz. 

(I) C k (z n ) = k C^ (z n ') - (A-l) C k (*'),

For if, in the first place, we have C k _i (z n ') -> ^, then, by f rheorem 1, we 
have also C k (z n ') -+ t>. Hence by (I), 

Cafo.) -**-(*-!)=. 

If, in the second place, C k (z n ) -> , then, by 43, 2, so do the arithmetic 
means 



and, with equal ease, (II) provides that 45 



Accordingly all reduces to verifying the two relations (I) and (II), 
and this may be done for instance as follows: 



44 Andersen, A. F.: Bemerkung zum Beweis des Herrn Knopp fur die Aqui- 
valenz der Cesdro- und //o/^r-summabilitat. Math. Zeitschr. Vol. 28, pp. 356 359. 
1928. 

46 If M denotes the operation of taking the arithmetic mean of a sequence, 
the above relations (I) and (II) may be written in the short and comprehensive form 
(I) C k = k C k _! M - (k - 1) C fc M, 

(II) C k = k C k _! M-(k-l)M C k . 

Each of these follows from the other if it is known *hat the C^-transformation and 
the process of taking the arithmetic mean are two commutable operations. 



60. The C- and //-processes. 483 



In 265, 3, the iterated sums S^ were formed, to define the C & - 
transformation of a sequence (s n ). Let us denote these sums more precisely 
by S^ (s), and use the corresponding symbols when starting with other 
sequences. The identity 



then implies 

n + k 2 v 



Here write i> + 1 = (n + k) (n + k 1 i/), 

and observe that 

in + k 2 A , . - , /7 T N (n + k 1 



It then follows further that 

(*) ^ (*) = (* + *) S^*- 1 ' (-') -(*- 

Dividing by f w , J, we deduce at once the relation (I). 

On the other hand, by the definition of the quantities S ( n , we have 



. 

Substituting in (*), we get 

(**) sf? (*) - ( -J- 1) ^ (-') - ( + *) s^ (*'), 

and hence, dividing by ( " k J, 

C k (ar n ) = ( + 1) C k (.') - n C A (y_i). 

Substituting in turn 0, 1, . . . , n for n in this relation, and adding, we 
obtain finally 

C k (*) + C k (*J + . . . + C k (xr n ) 

w 4- l = ^fc(). 

Put into words, this relation signifies that the arithmetic mean of the C fc - 
transformations of a sequence is equal to the C fc -transformation of its 
arithmetic means, or, as we say for short, the C^-transformation and the 
process of forming the arithmetic mean are two commutable operations 4d . 

* 6 Cf. preceding footnote 45. 



484 Chapter XIII. Divergent series. 

Now if we substitute for C k (z n f ) in (I) tue expression just found, we 
obtain (II) at once. This completes the proof of the Equivalence Theorem. 

After thus establishing the equivalence of the C-process and the 
//-process, we need only consider one of them. As the C-process is easier 
to work with analytically, on account of the explicit formulae 265, 3 for 
the S^'s, it is usual to give the preference to it. 

We next inquire how far its range of action extends, i. e. what are 
the necessary conditions to be satisfied by a sequence in order that it may 
be limitable C k . Using the notation, which was introduced by Landau 
and has been generally adopted, x n -- O (w a ), a real, to indicate that the 

sequence ( *JM is bounded, and x n o (w a ) to indicate that (*%\ is a null 

sequence 47 , we have the following theorem, which may be interpreted by 
saying that sequences whose terms increase too rapidly are excluded from 
C A -limitation altogether: 

271. j Theorem 3. If 2 a n , with partial sums s nj is summable C k , then 

a n = o (n k ) and s n = o (n k ). 

Proof. For k = 0, the statement is a consequence of Theorem 82, 
1, which we are generalizing. For k ^ ], with the notation of 265, 3, 
the sequence of numbers 

c<*) o^*" 1 ) i i o< 4 -*) 






(n + 
\ k 



k\ n + k

is convergent. Since ( n + * ~~ l \ ~ ( n "t *), the sequence 



cn 



is convergent, with the same limit. The difference of the two quotients, 
viz. S*' 1 /^ 1 *"*)' therefore forms a nul1 sequence. As 
this implies that S^~ l) = o (n k ). It follows that 

s (k-2) = S (k-l) __ s (k- = Q ^ + Q (//fc) = Q (n 

and similarly 48 



47 The first statement thus implies that the quantities | x n \ are of at moit 
the same order as const. w a , the second that they are of smaller order than w a , in 
the way in which they increase to +on. 

48 The reader will be able to work out quite easily for himself the very simple 
rules for calculations with the order symbols O and o which are used here and in 
the sequel. 



60. The C- and //-processes. 485 

The intermediary result 4 S^~ 1) = o (n k ) just obtained in the proof may 

be interpreted as an even more significant generalization of the theorem 
in question. In fact, it means that 



rn 

We accordingly have the following elegant analogue of 82, 1: 

Theorem 4. In a series E a n > summable C A , we necessarily have 272. 
C fc -Iim n w - 0. 

Moreover, even Kronecker's theorem 82, 3 has its exact analogue, 
though we shall confine ourselves to the case p n = n: 

Theorem 5. In a series a n , summable C kJ we necessarily have 273.

In fact, it follows from the corollary to 270 that C\ (s n ) -> s involves 
CK-I \ Sl T~{~ J ~^ s ' anc ^ therefore by the permanence theorem 
C k (- "*" ^A^p^ 1 - 71 ) -> * Subtracting this from C k (s n ) ~> s, we at once

By means of these simple theorems, the range of action of the C fc - 
process is staked off on the outside, as we might say, for the theorems inform 
us how far at most the range may extend into the domain of divergent 
scries. Where this range properly begins is a much more delicate question. 
By this we mean the following: Every series convergent in the usual sense 
to the value s is also summable C K (for every k > 0) to the same value s. 
Where is the boundary line, in the aggregate of all series which are summable 
C fc , between convergent and divergent series? On this point we have the 
following simple theorem, relating solely to the C^-process: 

Theorem 6. If the series 2 a n is C ^summable to sum s, ami if 274, 
8, = ^i^^^~-^ w -> Q, then Za n is in fact convergent with sum 
s. For (v. supra) 



_ _ _

whence the proof of the statement is immediate 49 . The last expression 

49 With reference to 262, 1 (or 43, Theorem 2), and to 82, Theorem tt, \\e may 
express the theorem as follows: A series a n converges if, and only if, it is C\- 
summable with S n -> 0, 



486 Chapter XIII. Divergent series. 

tends, in particular, to if a n = o (~j . A much deeper result is the fact 
that a n = O (j suffices, i. e. 



Theorem 6a. If a series E a n is summable C k and if its terms a n satisfy 
the condition 



then Z a n is convergent. (O-C k -> K-theorem) 50 . 

A proof of this theorem may be dispensed with here, since it will 
follow as a simple corollary of Littlewood's theorem 287. The direct proof 
would not be essentially easier than the proof of that theorem. 

00 00 I 

Application. The series 2 a n = 2 1+a< , a ^ 0, is not convergent, 

w = l n = l w 

as it is easy to verify, by an argument modelled on the proof on p. 442, footnote 
54 , that for n = 1, 2, . . . , 



with (^ w ) bounded. Further, for this series (n a n ) is bounded, hence the series cannot 
be summable C k to any order. 

Closely connected with the preceding, we have the following theorem, 
where for simplicity we shall confine ourselves to summation of the first 
order. 



275* Theorem 7. A necessary and sufficient condition for a series Za n , with 
partial sums s n9 to be summable C l to the sum s, is that the series

Cf. also the author's work I. quoted on p. 481, tootnote 42. The theorem deduces 
convergence (K) from C-summabihty. We accordingly call it a C -> K theorem for 
short, and more precisely an O-C -> K theorem, since an O (that is, the bounded- 
ness of a certain sequence) is employed in the determining hypothesis. A theorem 
of this kind was first proved by A. Tauber, in his case, for the .^-process (v. 
286) ; for this reason, Hardy gives the name of "Tauberian theorems" to all theorems 
in which ordinary convergence is deduced from some type of summability. We 
shall call them converse theorems or, more precisely, hmitizing converse or averaging 
converse theorems,.

But owing to T n -> $, it follows from this that the sequence (s n ) is limitable 
C 1 to the \ aluc s, as required 52 . 

We shall content ourselves with these general theorems on C-sum- 
mability 53 and we shall now proceed to a few applications. 

Among the introductory remarks (pp. 461 102), it was pointed out 
that the problem of multiplication of infinite series, which remained very 
difficult and obscure as long as the old concept of convergence was scrupu- 
lously adhered to, may be completely solved in an extremely simple manner 
when the concept of summability is admitted. For the second proof of 
Abel's theorem (p. 322) provides the 

276. Theorem 8. Cauchy'sproductSc n = Z(a Q b n + a l b n _ 1 + . . . + a n b Q ) 
of two convergent series 2a n A and Sb n B is always summable C 1 
to the value C = A B. 

Over and above this, we now have the following more general 

277. Theorem 9. // 2a n is summable C a to the value A and 2 b n is sum- 
mable Cp to the value B, then their Cauchy product 

2c n = Z K b n + ai *_! + . . . + a n * ) 

is certainly summable C t , to the value C A B, where y a + /? + 1. 
Proof. Let us denote by A ( *\ B%\ C ( ^ the quantities which in 

the case of our three scries correspond to the S n s of the general C-process 
as described in 265, 3. For | x \ < 1, since 

Za n **-Zb n x = 2:c n & 9 

we have 54 



Hence, by 265, 3, 



62 The theorem may be established similarly for summability C fc ; cf. the 
paper quoted in footnote 42, p. 481. 

63 A very complete account of the theory is given by Andersen, A. P.: Studier 
over Cesaro's Summabihtetsmetode, Kopenhagen 1921, and E. Kogbetliantz , Som- 
mation des series et integrates divergentes par des moyennes arithme'tiques et 
typiques, Memorial des Sciences math., Fasc. 51, Paris 1931. 

54 Since a n = o ( a ), b n = o (n^), the power series employed are absolutely 
convergent for | x \ < 1. 



60. The C- and H-processes. 489 

But from this the statement required follows immediately, by Theorem 
43, 6. We need only write 

^(oe) B (ft) /i' -f a\ /n v -f- 

*"(":? """c:"')' '~~~ ! ~r.T 

in that theorem, so that 

c (r) 

^- 



By the h) r potheses made, we have x n > A, y n -> /?, and the a rn . clearly 
satisfy the four requirements of the theorem. Hence the last expression 
tends to A B as n -> -I- GO. 

Examples and Remarks. 

1. If the series S ( l) n is multiplied by itself (k 1) times in succession, 
we obtain the series 



The original scries (k -- 1) being summable Cj by 262, its square is (certainly) 
summable C 3 , its cube summable C 5 , etc. However, by 268, 2, we know that the 
k th of these series is (exactly) summable C k . 

2. These examples show that the order of summability of the product-series 
given by theorem is not necessarily the exact order, and that in special cases it 
may actually be too high. This is not surprising, inasmuch as we already know 
that the product of two convergent series (k 0) may still be convergent. The 
determination of the exact order of summability of the product series requires a 
special investigation in each case. 

In conclusion, we will investigate one more theorem which may be 
materially extended by introducing summability in place of convergence, 
namely Abel's limit theorem 100 and its generalization 233: 

Theorem 10. If the power series f(x) = Za n z tl is of radius 1 and is 278. 
summable C k to the value s at the point + 1 of the circumference of the unit 
circle^ then 



for every mode of approach of z to + 1 in which z remains within an angle 
of vertex + 1, bounded by two fixed chords of the unit circle (v. Fig. 10, 
p. 406). 

Proof. As in the proof of 233, we choose any particular sequence 
of points (s , z l9 . . . , A > . . .) within the unit circle and the angle, and 
tending to + 1 as limit. We have to show that/(# A ) -> $, Apply Toepfitz 9 



490 Chapter XIII. Divergent series. 

theorem 221 to the sequence 55 a n = S ( / (" + k \ which by hypothesis 
converges to s, using for the matrix (0 An ) 



We deduce at once that the transformed sequence also tends to s: 



w-O w-0 



Since Z* St z n = __ .^ /(~)> this is exactly what our statement im- 

plied. For this proof to be correct, we have, however, still to verify that 
the chosen matrix (a\ n ) satisfies the conditions (a), (b) and (c) of the 
theorems 221. Since # A -> 1, this is obvious for (a); and, since 



(c) is also fulfilled. The condition (b) requires the existence of a constant 
K! such that 

1 __ y I \*+l 
* ^X I 



(I 1 _ 
I * 
T 



for every A. By the considerations on p. 406, this is obviously the case 
with K' = K k+1 , if K has the meaning there laid down. 

For k = 0, this is exactly the proof of Abel's theorem as carried out 
on pp. 406 407, in the generalized form of Stolz. For k = 1, we obtain 
an extension of this theorem, first indicated by G. Frobenius 56 , and for 
k 2, 3, . . . we obtain further degrees of generalization, due in sub- 
stance to O. Holder 57 taking H k - instead of C /c -summability and 
approaching along the radius instead of within the angle only and first 
expressed in the form proved above (though with entirely different proofs) 
by E. Lasher 58 and A. Pringsheim 59 . 

By this theorem 10, we have, in particular, lim (2 a n x n ) = s, for 
real x's increasing to + 1, and accordingly we can express the essential 
content of the theorem in the following short form, which is more in 
keeping with the context: 

Theorem 11. The C k ~summability of a series E a n to a value s always 
involves its A-summability to the same value. 



66 h is now the fixed order of the assumed summability.

60. The C- and H-processes. 491 

With the exception of the C^-summation of Fourier sene^, \\hich 
will be considered more fully in the following section, further applications 
of the Cfc-process of summation mostly penetrate too deeply into the 
theory of functions to permit us to discuss them in any detail. We should, 
however, like to give some account, without detailed proofs, of an appli- 
cation which has led to specially elegant results. This is the application 
of C 7c -summation to the theory of Dirichlet series. 

The Dirichlet series 



is 60 convergent for every z for which M (xr) > 0, divergent for every other 

r 
z. At the point 0, however, where it reduces to the series 21 ( I)"" 1 , 

n 1 

it is summable C l to the sum at the point 1, where it reduces to 

* I 

( l)"^ 1 n, it is (cf. p. 465) summable C 2 to the sum ; and the in- 

n \ 4 

dications given in 268, 3 show that for z (k 1) the series is sum- 
mable C k to the sum " -, - B k , for every integral value of k '^~ 2. 

This property of being summable C A , for a suitable /e, outside its 
region of convergence 9i (z) > 0, is not restricted to the points mentioned; 
it can be shown by relatively simple means that our series is summable 
C fc for every z with SR (z) > k. Moreover the order of summability 
is exactly k throughout the strip 

*<8t(*)^-(*- 1). 

Thus in addition to the boundary of convergence, we have boundaries 
of summabilily of successive orders, the domain in which the series is 
certainly summable to order k being, in fact, the half-plane 

%(#)>- (*-0, 1, 2, . ..). 

Whereas formerly it was only with each point of the right hand half- 
plane JR (z) > that we could associate a "sum" of the series Z - -j- -, 

we now associate such a sum with every point of the entire plane, thus 
defining a function of z in the whole plane. In a way quite analogous to 
that used for points within the domain of convergence of Dirichlet's series, 
further investigations now show that these functional values also repre- 



flo /() -- (l - 2*) * (;?) ' where <-) ^ J? ^ is Riemann** ^-function. (Cf. 
256, 4, 9, 10 and 11.) 



492 Chapter XIII. Divergent series. 

sent an analytic function in the domain of summability i. e. in the 
whole plane. Our series therefore defines an integral function 61 . 

Quite analogous properties of summability belong in general to 
every Dirichlet series fi2

z". 

W"l n 

Besides the boundary of convergence $1 (z) = A, or AQ, as we shall 
now prefer to write, since convergence coincides with C -summability, 
we have the boundaries $1 (z) A fc for C fc -summability, k -= 1, 2, . . . . 
They are defined by the condition that the series is certainly summable 
to the 7* th order for Sft (z) > X k , but no longer so for 3J (z) < A A . We of 
course have A ^ Aj ^ A 2 ^ . . . , and the numbers A*, therefore tend 
cither to oo or to a definite finite limit. Denoting this in either case 
by A y the given Dirichlet scries is summable C k for every z with $R (z) > A, 
\\here k is suitably chosen, and its sum defines an analytic function which 
is regular in this domain. If A is finite, the straight line JR (z) A 
is called the boundary of summability of the series. 

For the investigation of the more general Dirichlet series, (v. p. 441, 
footnote 52) 

Za n e-* s , 

it has been found more convenient to use Riesz 9 /^-summation. Cf. 
the tract by Hardy and Riesz mentioned in 266, 2. 

61. Application of C^-summation to the theory 
of Fourier series. 

The processes described above possess the obvious advantage of 
all summation processes, namely, that many infinite series which pre- 
viously had to be rejected as meaningless are henceforth given a useful 
meaning, with the result that the field of application of the theory of 
infinite series is considerably enlarged. Apart from this, the extremely 
satisfactory nature of these processes from a theoretical point of view 
lies in the fact that many obscure and confusing situations suddenly be- 
come very simple when these processes are introduced. The first example 
of this was afforded by the problem of the multiplication of infinite series 
(see p. 461-2, also p. 488). But the application of C^-summation which 



61 From this it follows fairly simply that for Riemann's f -function the differ- 
ence (z) -^_- , is an integral function, an important result.

is, perhaps, the most elegant in this respect, as well as the most important 
in practice, is the application to the theory of Fourier series, due to L. 
Fejtr 63 . As we have seen (pp. 369370), the question of the necessary 
and sufficient conditions under which the Fourier series of an integrable 
function converges and represents the given function is one which pre- 
sents very great difficulties. In particular, it is not known e. g. what type 
of necessary and sufficient conditions a function continuous at a point 
x must satisfy at that point in order that its Fourier series may converge 
there and represent the functional value in question. In 49, C, we became 
acquainted with various criteria for this; but all of these were sufficient 
conditions only. It was for a long time supposed that every function /(#) 
which is continuous at x possesses a Fourier series which converges at 
that point and has the sum/(# ) there. An example given by du Bois- 
Reymond (see 216, 1) was the first to discredit this supposition. The 
Fourier series of a function which is continuous at X Q may actually diverge 
at that point. 

The question becomes still more difficult, if we require only as 
the minimum of hypotheses regarding f(x) that the (integrable) func- 
tion f(x) should be such that the limit 

Km | [/(* + 2 t) + f(x - 2 0] - * (* ) 

*->* o 

exists. What are the necessary and sufficient conditions which must be ful- 
filled by f(x) in order that its Fourier series may converge at x and have 
the sum s (x ) ? 

As was pointed out, this question is not yet solved by any means. 
Nevertheless, this obscure and confusing situation is cleared up very 
satisfactorily when the consideration of the summability of Fourier series 
Q-summability is quite sufficient is substituted for that of their 
convergence. In fact we have the following elegant 

Theorem of Fejer. If a function /(#), which is integrable in 280. 
fg x ^ 2 77 and periodic with period 2 TT, is such that the limit 

Um } [/(* + 2 /) + /(* - 2 /)] = i (* )

value s (XQ). 

Proof. Let

Consequently, for n = 1, 2, . . . ,

in this case the limit of the ratio for t -> k IT, which is evidently 0. Hence **

As contrasted with Dirichlet's integral, the critical factor ~L? occurs 

to the second power in the above integral which is called Fejfr's 
integral for short and therefore the latter can never change sign ; to 

this and to the fact that the whole is multiplied by - the success of the 
subsequent part of the proof is due. If then the limit

64 Here the arithmetic mean of the numbers s n is denoted by a n = a n (x) 
instead of by s n ' == s n ' (x), to avoid confusion with the notation for differentiation. 

65 The value of the integral may also be inferred directly from Fefer's integral 
itself, for/(ar) = 1, for which a = 2 and the remaining Fourier constants = O f

In order to prove that a n-1 or <r n -+ s, it is therefore sufficient to show that

Now this follows from a very simple train of inequalities. As 9 (t) -> 0,

choose w so large that this expression becomes < ^e for every n > . 
We then have 

| o- w _! - s | < e 

for these w's; hence a n ->s. Thus Fejfr's theorem is completely estab- 
lished 66 . 

282. Corollary 1. If f(x) is continuous in the interval ^ x ^ 2 IT, 
and if further /(O) =/(27r), /fow /fo Fourier series off(x) is summable C l to 
the sumf(x),for every x. For the hypotheses of Fcjer's theorem are now cer- 
tainly fulfilled for every x, and s (x) = f(x) everywhere. We assume, as usual, 
that the function f(x) is defined in the intervals Zkir <^ x < 2(k+ I)TT, for 
* = i 1 i 2, . . . , by means of the periodicity condition, f(x) =f(x 2kfr). 

We now further state: 

Corollary 2. With the conditions of the preceding corollary, the C t - 
summability, which has been established for all x's, is, moreover, uniform 
for all x's, i. e. the sequence of functions a n (x) tends uniformly to f (x) for 
all x's. In other words : Given e > 0, we can determine one number N 
such that for every n > N, irrespective of the position of x, we have 87 

K (*)-/(*) I <* 

Proof. We have only to show that the inequalities in the proof 
of the theorem can be arranged so as to hold for every x. Now 

9 (0 = 9 ft *) = | [/(* + 2 -/<*)] + \ [/(* - 2 -/(*)]; 

since f(x) is periodic and is continuous everywhere, it is uniformly con- 
tinuous for all #'s (cf. 19, theorem 5), and, given e, we can choose one 
8 > such that 

|/(* 20 -/(*)!<! 

for every | t \ < 8, and every x. This implies that for all these t's 



irrespective of x\ hence, as before,

Further, since /(#) is periodic and is continuous everywhere, it is bounded, 
say \f(x) | < K for every x. It follows at once that for all t's and all #'s, 



66 Note in passing that the curves of approximation y <r n (a:) do wo* exhibit 
phenomenon (v. 216, 4). (Fejtir, L.: Math. Annalen, Vol. 64, p. 273. 1907.) 
87 The corresponding statement holds, moreover, in the case of the general 
theorem of Fejer for every closed interval entirely contained, together with its end-

Now we can actually determine one number N such that the last ex- 
pression remains < e for every n ^ N. For these w's we therefore have 
| cr n _ 1 s\ < e, so that, as asserted, we can associate with every given e 
orte number N such that 

KM -/(*)! <e 

for every n > N, irrespective of the position of x. 

As an easy application, the following important theorem results from 
the above theorems: 

Weierstrass's Approximation. If F (x) is a function continuous282a. 
in the closed interval a ^ x 5^ b, and if e > is arbitrarily assigned, then 
there is always a polynomial P (x) with the property that, in a ^ x ^ 6, 

|F(*)-P(*)|<. 

Proof. Put F (a + b -^ *) - /(*). Then / (x) is defined and 
continuous in <^ x <^ TT. In TT <^ x ^ 2 ?r, write as in 50, 2 nd method. 
/(*) =/(%'* *) Define /(^) for all other * by the periodicity con- 
dition f(x \-27r)=f(x). Then f(x) is everywhere continuous. Now, 
for this /(#), let <r n (^) have the meaning laid down in the statement of 
the preceding theorem. An index m may then be found such that 

\f(x)-* m (x)\<\ 

for all x. This a m (x) is the sum of a finite number of expressions of the 
form a cos/) x + b sin <?#; hence it can be expanded in a power series 
convergent everywhere, by means of the power series of 24. Let 

CQ + ^X+ ... + C n X n + ... 

denote this expansion. Since it converges uniformly in ^ x 5^ 77, we 
can determine a finite k so that the polynomial 

k 



satisfies the inequality | a m (x) p (x) \ < | 
throughout 5^ x ^ TT. Hence it satisfies 

!/(*)- H*)l<* 

Putting finally /> (J^J n) - P (*), 

we see that P(x) is a polynomial of the required kind, since, throughout 
a ^ * ^ b, 

\FM-PM\ <e. 



498 Chapter XIII. Divergent series. 

62. The -^-process. 

The last theorem of 60 has already shown that the range of action 
of the ^-process embraces that of all the C fc -processes. In this respect 
it is superior to the C- and //-processes. Also, it is not difficult to give 
examples of series which are summable A but not summable C k to any 
order &, however large. We need only consider Za n x n , the expansion 
in power series of 



at the point x = 1. Since obviously limf(x) exists for x -> 1 + 
and = Ve, the series S ( l) n a n is summable A to the value Ve. If, 
however, it were summable C kt for some specific k, by 271 we should 
require to have a n = o (n k ). Now a particular coefficient a n is obtained 
by adding together the coefficients of x n in the expansions of the indi- 
vidual terms of the series, which is uniformly convergent for | x \ ^ g < 1 : 



1 
21 



(v. 249). As all the coefficients in these expansions are positive, a n is 
certainly greater than the coefficient of x n in the expansion of a single 
term. Picking out the (k + 2) th term, we see that 



n 

*(* + 2)! V *+l (k + 2)! (* + !)! 

For a fixed k, a n /n k therefore cannot tend to 0; on the contrary, it tends 
to +00. 

Although the ^4-process is thus more powerful than all the (^-processes 
taken together, it is, nevertheless, restricted by the very simple stipulation 
that in order that it may be applicable to a series S a nt the series S a n x n 
and 2 s n x n must converge for | x \ <l: 

283. Theorem 1. If the series S a w with partial sums s ny is summable A, 
ecessarily have 

fim~v']~07[ g 1 and Ifin v'j"^"] ^ 1 
or, what comes to exactly the same thing, 

fl n = 0((l + e)) and s n = O ((1 + e)) , 

for every s > 0, however small. 

In this we have a companion to theorem 3 of 60; but theorems 
4 and 5 of that section also have literal analogues in this connection: 

284. Theorem 2. In a series E a n , which is summable A, we necessarily have 

A i- rv j j j AT f a i + 2 fl g -i ---- -f na n \ n 

-4-hm a n = and indeed A-\im - ~- -- = 0. 



62. The ^4-process. 499 

Proof. The first of these two relations indicates that (1 x) S a n x n 
must tend to as x -> 1 0. This is almost obvious, since by hypothesis 
E a n x n -> s. The truth of the second statement follows, on the same 
lines as the proof of 273, from the two relations 

(*) (!-*)*,,*-.* and (l-^-^ + VVi '"*"-** 

by subtraction; the first of these is nothing more than an explicit form 
of the hypothesis that 2 a n is summable A, while the second is quite 
easily deduced from it. In fact, from (1 x) 2s n x n -> s, we first infer 
that 



by 102. That the second of the relations (*) follows from this, is a special 
case of the following simple theorem: 

Auxiliary theorem. //, for x - 1 0, a function f(x), which is 285. 
integrable in 0^ x^l, satisfies the limiting relation

then, for x -> 1 0, we also have 





The proof follows immediately from the rule known as PHospitaPs, 
by which 

r FM ,- F'(v) 

nm = lim ' 



provided the right hand side exists and G (x) is positive and tends to 
+ 00 as #-> 1 0. The direct proof is as follows 68 : 

Put (1 x) 2 f(x) = s + g (x). The function g (x) tends to as 
x -> + 1 0, and so for any given e > 0, we can assign an x l in < x 1 < 1, 

such that | g (x) \ remains < 2 for x < x < 1. We then have, for these 
values of x, 





From this the statement follows in the usual way. 

By these theorems 1 and 2 we have to some extent fixed outer limits 
to the range of action of the -4-process. As before (cf. the developments 

68 The proof is on quite similar lines to that in 43, 1 and 2. The meaning 
of the assertion under consideration, that the first of the relations (*) implies the 
second, may also be stated thus: 

^4-lim s n = s implies A C^lim s n = s.

cation first of the Ci-orocess. and then of the ^4-orocess. for the limitation of (s-\

on p. 485 -()), th'j question as to the point, beyond the region of series which 
actually converge, at which its action begins is a much more delicate one. 
In this connection we have the following theorem due to A. Tauber* 9 : 
286. Theorem 3. A series Z a n> which is summable A, and for which na n ^>0, 
i. e. for which 

--Q- 

is convergent in the usual sense. (o-A - > K-theorem.) 

Proof. If we are given e > 0, we can choose n Q > so that for 
every n > ;/

(Here a) and c) can be satisfied by hypothesis, and b) by referring to 
43, 2.) For these 's and for every positive x < 1, we then have 

n r> 

s n s=f(x) s + Sa v (1 x v ) E a v x v . 

v-l v n \ 1 

If we now observe that in the first of the sums 

(1 - *") = (1 - *) (1 + * + . . . + ff- 1 ) < v (1 - x), 

and in the second | a v \ = "* < ^ , it follows that 

I *. -* I ^ !/(*) - I + a- *)^l ** I + -r,r ( r- 3' 

for every positive x < 1. Choosing, in particular, x = 1 , we obtain, 
by a), b) and c), 



for every n > n Q . Hence s n -> 5, q. e. d. 

In this proof, if we interpret e as being, not an arbitrary prescribed 
positive number, but a suitably chosen (sufficiently large) one, then we 
may infer the following corollary: 

Corollary. A series 2 a n , summable A, with (na n ) bounded, i. e. one 
for which 

- 

has bounded partial sums. 

On account of the great similarity between this theorem and theorem 
6 of 60, it appears likely that an O-A -> J^-theorem also holds, i. e. one 



69 Tauber, A.: Ein Satz aus der Theorie der unendlichen Reihen, Monats- 
hefte f. Math. u. Phys., Vol. 8, pp. 273277. 1897. Cf. p. 486, footnote 50. 



62. The ^[-process. 501 

which deduces the convergence of S a n from its ^-summability, by as- 
suming, as regards the n 's, merely the fact that they arc O (-J. This 
theorem is actually true. It goes very much deeper, however, and was 
proved for the first time in 1910, by J. E. Littlewood: 

1 Theorem 4. A series 2 a nt which is summable A, and whose terms 3^7 . 
satisfy the relation 

.=<), 

i. e. for which (n a n ) is bounded, is convergent in the ordinary sense. 
(O-A -> K-theorem.) 

Before going on to the proof, we may mention that this theorem 
contains, as a corollary, Theorem 6 of 60, as already stated there. For 
if a series is summable C ky then by Theorem 11, 60, it is also summable 
A. Every series, therefore, that satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 6, 
60, also satisfies those of Littlewood's theorem just stated, and is therefore 
convergent. 

Previously known proofs of Littlewood's theorem were very com- 
plicated, in spite of the number of researches devoted to it 71 , till in 1930 
J. Karamata 72 found a surprisingly simple proof. We shall preface his 
argument with the following obvious lemma: 

Lemma. Let g and e be arbitrary real numbers, and let f(t) denote the 
following function 73 , defined and integrable (in the Riemann sense) over the 
interval ^ * <^ 1 (v. Fig. 13): 




Then there exist two polynomials p (t) and P (t) for which

Proof of Littlewood's theorem. 

I. By the corollary to theorem 3, the sequence ($ n ), under present 
hypotheses, is certainly bounded. 

In proceeding with the proof, it will be no restriction to assume the 
terms of the series Z a n to be real. For, once the theorem is proved for real 
series, it can be inferred immediately for series of complex terms by split- 
ting these up into their real and imaginary parts. 

II. Let g be given > 0, and put [(1 + g) n] == k (n) = k. Let s n denote 
as usual the partial sums of a nj and y for n > -, write 74 

u 

Max | s v s n | = p n (e), 

n<v^_k 
and 

lim p. n (Q) = //. (g).

Then JJL (g) -> as g -> 0. 

Indeed, for n < v ^ k, we have 

| Sv S n | = I nn + n+2 + + <*v I 

^ (k n) Max ( | a n+1 \ , | a n+2 1 , . . , | a k \ ). 
If | a r \ be this maximum, it follows further that 

\* v -tn\< -^ ' r I a r | ^ Q r \ a r \. 

Now, (// a n ) being assumed bounded, there exists a constant K such that 
n I a n \ < ^ for all //, and so 

Mn (6) = Max | ^ *n | ^ 6 ^- 
n<-v<k 

Thus /* (e) ^ e ^ 

whence the statement follows.

sequences t n = s n + M and u n = M instead of to s n . Subtracting the 
results, we get (*) in its full generality. 

IV. In III (*), put x = e~ n on the left hand side, and refer back to the 
definition of f(t) in the lemma; writing as before [(1 + g) n] k (n) = k, 
we infer that as n -> + GO, 

(1 *-s)_27 S V -*QS. 

Since n (1 *"") -> 1 and -~ w -> g, 

1 ^ 
we have then , ^ 27 s v -> ^.

Writing, therefore, ^_: w 27 f v s = 8 n ,

we have S n -> 0, and

n k n v ._. n ^i v n " 

Hence 

| s s n | ^ Max | s v ^ n | + | 8 n | = fji n (Q) + | 3 n \ . 

Making w -> + oo , we deduce

This completes the proof.

28S. Examples and Applications. 

1. Every series which is summable C is also summable A, to the same value. 
This often enables us to determine the values of series which are summable C. 
Thus in 268, 3 we saw that the series S ( l) n (n -f l) k are summable C fc+1 ; by 
means of the ^4-summation process we can now obtain the values of these series, 
which occur conveniently as the # h derivatives of the geometric series -( l) n x n t 
when the exponential function is inserted by substituting x e~*. In this way we 
obtain the series 

e -t _ e -*t + tr* -+..., 

convergent for t > 0. The sum of this series is 

__ e-* _ __ 1 e t - 1 _ ^j-J_-_2 1 __ 2 __ 

- l~+~j=i ~ e t + i " e *t _ i - e *t _ i -= e r_ i 6 2i _ i 

It __ 1 2t 

** t' e l - 1 / e** -I* 

For a sufficiently small t > 0, these last fractions may be expanded in power series 
by 105, 5; the first terms of the two expansions cancel each other and we obtain 



Differentiating k times in succession with respect to t t we further obtain 



oo on-f-i _ l 
= (~ !)*+' 27 (^ + , } y & H ( - 1) . . . ( - A + 1) "-*. 

Now, letting i diminish and -> + 0, we at once obtain on the right hand side 76 



Putting e~~* = x on the left hand side, we see that we are dealing with a power series 
of radius 1; when / decreases to 0, x increases to + 1. The value just obtained is 
therefore by definition the ^4-sum of the series 

1 _ 2 * + 3* - + . . . + (- 1) (n + 1)* + . . . 

for integral & p^ 0. And as this series was seen to be summable C k+i in 268, 3, 
we have thus obtained its C^ +1 -sum also, by 279. 

2. If the function represented by a power series 2 c n z n of radius r is regular 
at a point z^ of the circumference of the unit circle, lim / (x zj for positive in- 
creasing x -> 4- 1 certainly exists and =/(ari). At every such point the series 
2 a n = S c n z^ is therefore summable A and its ^4-sum is the functional value 



78 For h > 0, the sign ( I)** 1 may simply be omitted, by footnote 4, p. 237 



63. The E-process. 507 

3. Combining the preceding remark with theorem 4, we get the statement: 
If f(x) = Sc n z n converges for | s \ < 1 and (n c n ) is bounded, then the scries 
continues to converge (in the ordinary sense) at every point z lt on the circumference 
of the unit circle, at which /(#) is regular. 

4. Cauchy's product 2 c n 2 (a b H -| |- a n b Q ) of two series 2 a n and 

2b n , which are summable A to the values A and B, is also summable A, 
to the value C = AB, as an immediate consequence of the definition of ^-sum- 
mability. 

oo I 

5. With regard to the series J5J T^Ti*' a ^0> we have already seen 

w 1 

in 274 that these do not converge, and that they are not summable C^ to any 
order k. By Ltttlewood's theorem 4, we may now add that they cannot be 
summable A either. 



63. The E- process. 7? 

The ^-process was introduced on the strength of Euler's trans- 
formation of series (144). Starting from any series 2 a n (not having 
alternately -|" and signs), we should have to write 



and we should have to consider a n ' as the Zf, - transformation of 
H a n . We had agreed to depart from the usual notation so far as to write 78 
SQ = and s ti = a Q + &\ + + -i fc> r > 0, and similarly for 
the accented series. Then (v. 265, 5) 



is the EI - transfoi mation of the sequence (s w ). Applying this again, 
we obtain for the Zf a - transformation, after an easy calculation, 



Sa n ', with ^.- 
the partial sums of which are now 



7 A detailed investigation of this process is to be found in two papers 
by the author, Uber das Eulersche Summierungsverfahren (I: Mathemat. Zeitschr. 
Vol. 15, pp. 226253. 1922; II: ibid., Vol. 18, pp. 125156. 1923). Complete 
proofs of all the theorems mentioned in this section are given there. 

78 It may be verified without much difficulty that in the case of the E^- 
process "a finite number of alterations" is allowed, as in the case of con- 
vergent series. (A proof, into which we shall not enter here, is given in 
the first of the two papers mentioned in the preceding footnote.) Conse- 
quently the shifting of indices has no effect on the result of the limitation 
process. 



508 Chapter XIII. Divergent series. 

For the E v - transformation we obtain in the same way the series 

**?> 

with terms 



OyV ' \1/ ^ ' I 

and partial sums 79 (n > 0) 

(p) i (p^ i i (p) ( p) 



The examples given in 265, 5 have already illustrated the action 
of the E l - process; the last of them shows that the range of the 
ZTj- process is considerably wider than those of the C- and //-processes. 
By analogy with that example, we may form the /^-transformation of 
the geometric series 2z n , and we shall obtain 



This series converges 80 , to the sum 5-37-* if, and only if, 
1 2 _[_ (2 P 1) | < 2 P , i. e. if 2 lies within the circle of radius 2 P round 
the point (2 P 1). Evidently ^v^yy point in the half-plane 9ft (z) < 1 
can be made to lie inside such a circle, by taking the exponent p 
sufficiently large. We may accordingly say: The geometric series 2z n 

is summable E n to a suitable order p for each point z interior to the 

1 

half -plane 9ft(z)<l. The sum is in every case , i. e. it is the 

analytical extension of the function defined by the series in the unit 
circle. 

The case of any power series is quite similar, but in order to carry out 
the proofs we require assistance from the more difficult parts of function theory. 
We shall therefore content ourselves with indicating the most tangible results 81 : 

The power series 2c n z n is assumed to have a finite positive radius of 
convergence, and the function which it represents in its circle of convergence 
is denoted by f(z). This function we suppose analytically extended along every 
ray am z <p = const, until we reach the first singular point of ^(*) on this 
ray, which we shall denote by 7?- (If there is no singular point at all on the 
ray, it may be left entirely out of account.) For a particular integer p ^> 
we now describe the circle 






which corresponds to the one occurring in the case of the geometric series, 
and which we shall denote by K v . The points common to all the circles K<p 

70 The formula of this transformation suggests that, for the order p, the 
restriction to integers I> might be removed. Here, however, we shall not 
enter into the question of these non-integral orders. Cf. p. 467, footnote 18. 

80 This series is then, moreover, absolutely convergent. 

81 As regards the proof, see p. 507, footnote 77. 



63. The E- process. 509 

will, in the simplest cases (i. e. when there are only a small number of singular 
points), make up a curvilinear polygon whoso boundary consists of arcs of 
the different circles, and tt every case they will foim a definite set of points 
which we denote by (V) p . We then have the 

Theorem. For each fixed p, 2c n z n is summable E p at every interior point o/289 
<& p and the E p - transformation of 2c n z n is indeed absolutely convergent at that 
point. The numerical values thus associated with every interior point of & p form 
the analytical extension of the element 2c n z n into the interior of p . Outside & p9 
the E p - transformation of Sc n z n is divergent. 

After noting these examples, we now return to the general question, 
within what bounds the range of action of the E- process lies; in this 
as in further investigations, we shall restrict ourselves to the first order, 
i. e. to the ^-process. The cases of E- summation of higher orders 
are, however, quite analogous. 

Since Z^-summability of a series 2a n means, by definition, the 
convergence of its E } transformation 



the general term of the latter must necessarily tend to 0: 



which we may now write, for short, 

^-lim a n = 0. 

In this form, we again have an exact analogue to 82, 1 and 272 
or 284. Kronecker's theorem 82, 3 also has its analogue here. For 
if (s n ) is a sequence which is limitable E l with the value s, its E^ 
transformations E 1 (s n ) = s n ' > s . The arithmetic means 



of the latter therefore also tend to s; we may denote them for short by 
C 1 1 (s n ), since they are obtained by applying in succession first the 
Ej- transformation and then the C x - transformation. Now it is easy to 
show by direct calculation we prefer to leave this to the reader , 
that we obtain exactly the same result if we apply the C - transfor- 
mation first, and then the /^-transformation, i. e. if we form the 
sequence E, C, (sj = E, (*o + *. + --- + ^ . m hmg ^ ^ (sj ^ E ^ ( ^. 

the two transformations are completely identical 82 . Thus we also 

82 By calculation, the identity to be proved is at once reduced to the 
relation 



for < n < k, which is easily seen to be true. On account of the property 
in question, the E r and C t - transformations are said to be commutable. The 
corresponding property holds good for E p - and C tf - transformations of any 
order; in every case, E v C Q (s n ) = C Q E v (s n ). Cf. p. 482, footnote 45, and p. 4S3.

have 



E MLAIUM + s 

M n + l ) ** 

and subtracting this from 

E i(O-** 
we obtain, exactly as on p. 485, the relation stated, namely 



as a necessary condition for the Ej-sumrnability of the series 2a n . 
To determine further what the condition E l -Yima n = implies as 
regards the order of magnitude of the terms a n , we deduce from 



the expression for the M 's in terms of the a n "s: 



whence, as a n '+Q, it at once follows, by 4ft, 5, that 
J=-0 or a,, = o(3"). 

If we carry out the corresponding calculation lor s n and s n ', we simi- 
larly find that s n = o(3 n ). Summing up, we therefore have 
290. Theorem 1. The four conditions 



a n = o(3 n ) and s n =--o(3 n ) 

are necessary in order that the series 2a n , with partial sums s n , 
may be summable E { . 

A comparison of this theorem with the theorems 271 and 283 
and the examples for 265, 5 shows that the range of the /s'j-process is 
considerably more extensive than those of the C- and ^f-processes ; the 
/^-process is a good deal more powerful than these. The question, how- 
ever, which in the case of the C- and v4 -processes led to the theorems 
274 and 287, here reveals what may be described as a loss of sensitiveness 
in the /^-summation process, as compared with the C- and ^-processes. 
We in fact have 

5891. Theorem 2. // the series 2a n , with partial sums s w , is sum- 
mable E t to the value s, so that the numbers 



and if, besides this, we have 

W fl = 

then the series 2 a is convergent with the sum s - (0-E t * K- theorem}. 



63. The ^-process. 511 

Proof. We form the difference 



and we split up the expression on the right hand side into three parts: 
7\ + T 2 + TV T\ is to denote the part from v = to v w, T 3 the 
part from i/ 3 ;/ to ^ = 4 w, and T* 2 the remaining part in the middle. 
In virtue of (13) there certainly exists roughly estimated a constant 
K l such that | s n \ 5> ^i ^ n - Hence there also exists a constant K such 
that 

I s v s 2n | < A: v^" 

for every //, provided ^ v ^ 4: w. Hence | T 1 \ and j 7" 3 | are both 



Now for every integer k > 1, we have 83 

' 



*'<*). 

and accordingly 84 



16\ 

n 



Therefore 7\ and 7' 3 both tend to as n increases. 
In To, i. e. for n <. v <. 3 w, \ve have, by (B), 



if e n denotes the largest of the values | a^ +l \ \/n -f- 1, | a n+2 \ \/n + 2, . . . ; 
e n must tend to as n increases. Therefore 

I 2 I - \ it tZ^^ ' * \ v / *>4W \f n /-w V v i * 

" l> ll~\ L *" '* y \^^ 

This last sum is however easily seen to have the value n (<>)\ it suffices 
to separate 2 n v into 2 n and v. Thus 



88 This somewhat rough estimation for k ] t which, however, is often useful, 
is most simply obtained by multiplying together all the inequalities 

(l\v / l\vfl 

1+ i) <.<( 1+ _) 

(see 46 a) for v 1, 2, ...,* 1. 

84 Substitute ( J ~ ~ 1(3 )\ ancl use ^ n t ^ ie numerator tn e upper estimate 
for &', in the denominator the lower estimate. 



512 Chapter XIII. Divergent series. 

Thus, as fi n -*0, we have, by 219, 3, 

r,-*o. 

Summing up, we therefore have 

r t + r a + r 3 = s 4 ' M - S3n -*o. 

Now by hypothesis s^ >s, hence s an *s also; and further, since 
a v Q by (B), it finally follows that 

*n-* s > 
q. e. d. 85 . 

In conclusion, we shall also consider the question of the E-summa- 
bility of the product of two series which are summable E 19 as well 
as that of the relation of the range of action of the E-process to that 
of the C-process. 

As regards the multiplication problem, we have two theorems, 
which are the exact analogues of Mertens* theorem 188 and Abel's 
theorem 189. We confine ourselves to the development of the former 
and we therefore proceed to prove 

292. Theorem 3. Let the two series 2a n and 2b n be assumed to be 
summable E lt i. e. let their E^- trans formations, which we shall denote by 
2a n ' and 2b n ', be convergent. If one at least of the two latter series 
converges absolutely, then Cauchy's product 

Sc n = 2(a Q b n + a, b n _ l -\ \- a n b Q ) 

is also summable E^ y and between A, B, and C, the E^-sums of the 
three series, we have the relation A B = C. 

v 
Proof. By 265,5, for & = - - and for all sufficiently small 

values of x (v. theorem 1), we have 

f, (x) = 2X,*" +1 = ^ B '(2y), 
/;(*) = 2" &*+' = 2b n '(2 y), 
f t (x) = 2 c n x* = 2 c n ' (2 y)+. 
On the other hand 

/;(*)/;(*) = */;(*). 

Thus we have the identity 



84 The theorems 274 and 287 suggest that an O-E-+K- theorem may 
also hold here, i. e. one which enables us to infer the convergence of 2'a n 

from its ^-summability, provided that a n = O I = ) . This is actually the 

\V*7 

case, but the proof is so much more difficult than the above that we must 
omit it here. (Cf. the second of the papers referred to on p. 507, footnote 77.) 



63. The E- process. 
whence, besides cj = 2 a Q f 6 ', we obtain the general formula for n ^> 1: 

< = 2 &' + < c, + +' v) -- K' *i-i --+ ;~i v) 

Since by hypothesis one at least of the two series 2a n ' and 2b n ' is 
absolutely convergent, Cauchy's product, 2(a Q 'b n ' -] ----- h^/V)' * 
these two series is convergent and =/!#, by 188 From the last- 
obtained expression for c n ', the convergence of c n ' follows at once, 
and for its sum C we obtain 



- AB = AB, 

q. e. d. 86 

Finally, we shall examine the question of the relation between 
the C- and E -processes. It is very easy to show, in the first in- 
stance, that the processes fulfil the compatibility condition 263, III; 
i. e. that we have 

Theorem 4. If a series is summable C^ and also summable E lt 
'two processes give it the same value. 

Proof. If (c n ') is the C 1 -transformation and (s n ') the E 
'formation of (s w ), both these sequences are convergent, by hypothesis: 
say c^^c't s n f *$'. Since both processes satisfy the permanence 
condition, the T 1 - transformation of (s w ') also converges to s': 



and the E l -transformation of (c n f ) converges to c': 



With the abbreviated notation, these two relations are 

c*EM-** and ^cM-^tf. 

But, as was pointed out on p. 509, these two sequences are identical, 
so that s' must be equal to c', q. e. d. 

We have already seen (p. 508), from the example of the geometric 
series 2z n , that the ^-process is considerably more powerful than 
the C^- process. In fact, we cannot sum the geometric series by the 
latter anywhere outside the unit circle, while the E^- process enables 
us to sum it at every point of the circle | z + 1 1 < 2 . But this must 
not be interpreted to mean that the range of action of the Zij-process 
completely includes that of the Cj- process, much less those of all 
C k - processes. On the contrary, it is easy to give an instance of a se- 



86 The form of this proof suggests that in certain cases it will be con- 
venient to introduce the concept of absolute suramability: A series 2 a n will be 
said to be absolutely summable E l if 2*a n ', its E t - transformation, converges 
absolutely. 



514 Chapter XIII. Divergent series. 

quence (s n ) which is limitable C t , but not limitable E v The sequence 
(s w ) = 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, ... 

is of this type, where s v = v and every other s n = (i. e. for every 
index n which is not a perfect square). 

This sequence is limitable C 1 with the value ^ . For the largest 

values of the arithmetic means S ' MIL-g are obviously attained 

n-\- 1 J 

for n = v* and the least for n = v 9 1. The latter = ^~~j-^, the former

If the same sequence were also limitable E l we should therefore 
require to have ^(SjJ * -: but, for n = y' 2 , the (2 n) ili term of the

cannot -^. The sequence (sj is therefore not limitable E^ We may 
accordingly state: 

294. Theorem 5. Of the two ranges, that of the C^- process ant that 
of the E 1 -process, neither contains the other entirely. There are series 
which can be summed by the C^-process, but not by the E^ process, 
and conversely 87 . 

This circumstance raises the further question: which series, sunun- 
able Cj, can be summed by the Zs^ process? Little is as yet known on 
this subject, and we shall content ourselves with mentioning the foL ow- 
ing theorem: 

295. Theorem 6. // 2a n is summable C x , with 

*0-M|-f--"fr3|i __ c , 



then 2a n is also summable E^. (o C l E 1 theorem 88 .) 



87 The statement remains the same when higher orders of both processes 
are considered. 

88 The corresponding O-theorem does not hold, as has already been shown 

by the example on theorem 5, where the arithmetic mean is actually -f O { . ) 

-s \ \/ 1 1 / 



63. The E- process. 

Proof. Writing s n s = o n , the sequence (a n ) is limitable C l with 
the value 0. Put 

<*o + a i H h <*n ^ /. 

^r+i a n > 

by the hypotheses, we then have not only cr n ' >0, but also Vno n ' *0. 
Now we have the following general inequality, due to Abel: If 

<7 , a , . . ., a n are any numbers, a/ = ^ gl y+ 'i" ~ , (r = 0, 1, . . . , w), 
the corresponding arithmetic means; if, further, r is a number greater 
than all the (n + 1) quantities \o v '\ 3 for v = 0, 1, ...,n, and r k a 
number greater than all the quantities |a v '|, for &<^v<In; then, given 
any set of (n -f- l) positive numbers , # t , . .., # n , which increase 
monotonely to the term cc m and decrease monotonely from that term 
on, we have the following inequality 89 , if < p ^ m < n: 



0J -f 4- 



4- ^i) > " n 



h + * 

Applying this, for a fixed n > 8, to the numbers <J v> o v ' intro- 
duced above, and taking a v = ( J, v = 0, 1, 2, . . ., , we can choose 

for p the greatest integer <^ - , i. e. p = .- , and we may similarly 
take w ~ TT . We then obtain 



This inequality will hold a fortiori if we assume i to be greater than 
all the quantities | oj \ and r fe greater than all the quantities | aj 

with v ^> ^ . Now, by 219, 3, the greatest term ( ) of the values 
\m/ 

(") satisfies the limiting relation ^ fy -> -7=, so that ^? (^) is cer- 

tainly < 1 from some stage on. Since from some stage on we have also 
V?i < 3 Vp 9 it follows that, for all sufficiently large n, 



89 In fact, (TV = (v -f- 1) a^ v CTV_I and therefore, taking a n+1 0,

A. The summation formula. 

The range of action of all the summation processes with which we 
became acquainted in the last chapter was limited. It is only when the 
terms a n of 2 a w the divergent series under consideration, do not increase 
too rapidly as n increases that we can sum the series. Thus in the case 

of the .B-process, it is necessary that 27 - n f x n should be convergent every- 



where, i. e. that r-^- or -V^l^nj should tend to zero. Hence the 
\ n\ n 

B-process cannot be used e. g. for the series 

27 (- l) n H!=l- l!+2!-3! + 4l- + ... + (- !)! + ... . 

n-O 

Series like this one, and even more rapidly divergent series, occurred, 
however, in early investigations of the most varied kind. In order to deal 
conclusively with them by the methods used hitherto, we should have to 
introduce still more powerful processes, such as the l^-process. How- 
ever, no essential results have been obtained in this way. 

At a fairly early stage in the development of the subject other methods 
were indicated, which in certain cases lead more conveniently to results 
useful both in theory and in practice. In the case of the numerical evalua- 
tion of the sum of an alternating series 27 ( l) n a ny in which the a n 's 
constitute a positive monotone null sequence, we observed (see pp. 250 
and 251) that the remainder r n always has the same sign as the first term 
neglected, and, moreover, that it is less than this term in absolute value. 
Thus in the calculation of the partial sums we need only continue until 
the terms have decreased down to the required degree of accuracy. A 
somewhat similar state of affairs exists in the case of the scries 

t- = 1 - x + | a - + . . . + (- 1)- J + . . . , x > 0, 



64. Euler's summation formula. A. The summation formula. 519 

x n 
since the terms -, likewise decrease monotonely when n > x. We can 

therefore write 



for every n > #, where & stands for a value between and 1 , depending 
on x and n, but is otherwise undetermined. It is impossible in practice, 
however, actually to calculate e~ x from this formula when x is large, for 

e. g. when x 1000, the thousandth term is equal to "JQQQI. As 1000 1 



is a number with 2568 digits (for the calculation see below, p. 529), the 
term under consideration is greater than 10 431 , so that the evaluation of 
the sum of the series cannot be carried out in practice. From the theoretical 
point of view, on the other hand, the series fulfils all requirements, since 
its terms, which (for large values of x) at first increase very rapidly, never- 
theless end by decreasing to zero, and that for every value of x. Hence 
any degree of accuracy whatever can be obtained in theory. 

The circumstances are exactly the reverse, if we know that the value 
of a function /(#) is represented by the formula 



< # < 1, 

for every n. The series E '( l) n ~, whose partial sums appear in this 

formula, diverges for every x: but in contrast to nearly all the divergent 
series met with in the last chapter, the terms of the series (for large values 
of x) at first decrease very rapidly the series at first behaves like a con- 
vergent one and it is only later on that they increase rapidly and without 
limit. Hence we can calculate e. g. /(1000) to about ten decimal places 

with great case; we have only to find an n for which JQQQn+f < 2 l^" 10 . 
As this is true even for n = 3, the value sought is given by 

1 - 4- 2 -- ~ 
1 10 3 ^ 10 10* 



to the desired degree of accuracy. Thus it happens here that an expansion 
in powers, which takes the form of an infinite series which is divergent 
everywhere and very rapidly so, nevertheless yields useful numerical 
results, because it appears along with its remainder. We are not in a position, 
however, not even in theory to obtain any degree of accuracy what- 



520 Chapter XIV. Euler's summation formula and asymptotic expansions. 

ever in the evaluation of /(#), since f(x) is given by its expansion only 
with an error of the order of one of the terms of the series. The degree 
of accuracy therefore cannot be lowered below the value of the least term 
of the series. (A least term certainly exists, seeing that the terms finally 
increase.) As the example shows, however, in suitable circumstances all 
practical requirements may be satisfied. 

Series of the type described were produced for the first time by Euler's 
summation formula 1 , which we shall now consider more closely. 

If the terms a , a lt . . . , a n , . . . of a series 2 are the values of a func- 
tion f(x) for x = 0, 1, . . . , n, . . . , we have already proved by the in- 
tegral test (176) that in certain circumstances there is a relation between 
the partial sums s n = a Q + #1 + + <* n an d tne integrals 

J n =]f(x)dx. 



Euler's summation formula throws further light on this relation. If f(x) 
possesses a continuous differential coefficient in ^ x ^ n 9 then, for 
v = 0, 1, ...,- 1, 



v\\ 



1 



J (* - v - )/' (*) dx = [(* - v - *)/(*)] - J /(*) dx. 

V V 

Now, for each of the values v, we can put v = [x] in the integrand on the 
left, at least for v fg x < v + 1. Since, however, by 19, theorem 17, 
the one value x = v + 1 does not matter, we get 

v+l v+1 

i (fv +/M-I) = J /(*) rf * + J (* M - t)/ (*) ^*. 

v v 

(To simplify the writing, we denote by / and f^ respectively the values 
of f (x) and of its derivative f^(x) for integral values x= v.) Adding 
these relations for the relevant values of i>, and adjoining the term J (/ -f- / n ), 
we finally obtain the formula 



1 With regard to the summation formula cf. footnote 3, p. 521. The pheno- 
menon described above was first noticed by Euler (Commentarii Acad. sc. Imp. 
Petropolitanae, Vol. 11 (year 1739), p. 116, 1750); A. M. Legendre gave the name 
of semi-convergent series to series which exhibit this phenomenon. This name has 
survived to the present time, especially in astronomical literature, but nowadays 
it is being superseded by the term "asymptotic series", which was introduced by 
H. Poincare on account of another property of such series. 

8 In the subsequent remarks all the quantities are to be real.

This in fact is Euler's summation formula in its simplest form 3 . It gives 
a closed expression for the difference between the sum / + /i + +/

and the corresponding integral ff(x)dx.

We shall denote the function which appears in the last integrand 

byPi():

This is essentially the same function as the one which we met with 
in one of the first examples of Fourier expansions (see pp. 351, 375). 
It is periodic, with period 1, and for every non-integral value of 
x we have

8 The formula, in its general form 298, originated with Euler, who men- 
tioned it jn passing in the Commentarh Acad. Petrop., Vol. 6 (years 17323, 
published 1738) and illustrated it by a few examples. In Vol. 8 (year 1736, 
published 1741) he gives a proof of the formula. C. Mac lauri n uses the formula 
in several places in A Treatise of Fluxions (Edinburgh 1742), and seems to 
have discovered it independently. The formula became well-known, especially 
through Euhr's Institutiones calculi differentials, in the fifth chapter of which 
it is proved and illustrated by examples. For long it was known as Maclaunns 
formula, or the Euler-Maclaurin formula; it is only recently that Euler's un- 
doubted priority has been established. 

The remainder which is most essential was first added by 5. D. Poisson 
(v. Me"moires Acad. scienc. Inst. France, Vol. 6, year 1823, published 1827). The 
particularly simple proof given in the text is due to W. Wirtinger (Acta mathe- 
matica, Vol. 26, p. 255, 1902). 

An up-to-date, detailed, and expanded treatment is to be found in N.E. Ndr- 
lund's Differenzenrechnung, Berlin 1924, especially in chapters II V. 



522 Chapter XIV. Euler's summation formula and asymptotic expansions. 

We already know that this limit exists, from 1S8, 2. Now we have a new 
proof of this fact, and In addition we have an expression in the form of an 
integral for Ruler's constant C, by means of which we can evaluate the con- 
stant numerically. 

From the formula 296, i. e. 
(*) /o r- /i +- 



integration by parts leads to more advantageous representations. In 
order to be in a position to carry it out, we must first assume that/(#) 
has continuous derivatives of all the orders which occur in what follows; 
then we have to select an indefinite integral of P 1 (x), and an integral of 
the latter, and so on. By suitable choice of the constants of integration 
the further calculations are greatly simplified. We shall follow Wirtinger 4 
and set 

-ii / \ i \ i " { 



n~i \.* nn ) 

Then P 3 ' (x) P l (x), for every non-integral value of x, and Po(0) 

1 oo i i 

= -p 2 - J? a- = yo- Moreover, P 9 (#) is continuous throughout, and 

n=l 

has the period 1. We now proceed to set 

P.f*) = + S~ 



whence we have P 8 '(ic) = P 2 (a;) for wgyy value of x, P 3 (0) =-= 0, 
and in general 



297. ( a ) 



Then, for A = l, 2, ..., all these functions are throughout continuous 
and continuously differentiable, and have the period 1; and we have 



for ^, A = 1, 2, . . . (cf. 136). As is immediately obvious from the proof, 
in the interval 5^ x ^ 1 and for k ^ 2, the functions P k (x) are rational 

integral functions. Besides the fact that P x (x) = x 2 in < x < 1,

if we employ the symbolic notation already used in 1O5. These are 
the so-called Bernoulli's polynomials 5 , which play an important part in 
many investigations 6 . We shall meet with some of their important 
properties directly. 

First of all, however, we shall improve the formula (*) by means 
of these polynomials. Integration by parts gives

polynomial; others, again, give this name to the polynomial

for short. This is Euler's summation formula. 



Remarks. 
1. Since in the last integration by parts, namely 





the integrated part vanishes, on account of the fact that Pa*fi(w) '-= P2k+i(0) - 0, 
we may also write 

**-- fa* (*)/<*>(*)** 

o 

for the remainder term in the summation formula. 

2. If we put F (a + x h) = / (#), the formula takes the somewhat more general 
form, in which 

F(a) + F(a + h) + ... -f F(a + nh) 

forms the left hand side. The formula may therefore be used for the summation' 
of any equidistant values of a function. 

3. With suitable provisos, it is permissible t6 let n -> QO in the summation 
formula. According as Zf n converges or diverges, we then obtain an expression 
for the sum of the series or for the growth of its partial sums. The statement is. 
different (on the right hand side) for every value of k. 



64. Euler's summation formula. B. Applications. 525 

4. If we let k -> oo, R k may tend to 0. We should then have an infinite series 
on the right hand side, into which the sum on the left hand side is transformed. 
This case actually occurs very seldom, however, since, as we are aware (v. p. 237, 
footnote), Bernoulli's numbers increase very rapidly. The series 



k-1 

will turn out divergent for almost all the functions / (x) which occur in applications, 
no matter what n may be. Thus the formula suggests a summation process Jor a 
certain type of divergent series. Cf. however the example B. 3 below. 

6. Provided that the differences (f^ /o / ^ ave t ^ ie same s ig n m 

series just discussed is an alternating series, since the signs of the numbers B 2 \ 
are alternating. We shall see that, in spite of the divergence, the above-mentioned 
evaluation of the remainder of the alternating series remains valid. (Cf. the intro- 
ductory remarks to this section.) 

6. The formula will be useful only in the cases where, for a suitable value of 
k t R fc is small enough to give the desired degree of accuracy. At first sight, we have 
only the inequality 



at our disposal for the estimation of R k , for k S 2: but, as we see subsequently, 
the inequality also holds for k 1, and by 136 it can be put in the more precise 

I Ft I 
form | P k (x) | ^ J * J for even values of k. 



B. Applications. 

1. It is obvious that the most favourable results are obtained when 299. 
the higher derivatives of f(x) are very small, and especially when they 
vanish. We therefore first choose f(x) == x p , where p is an integer ^ 1, 
and we have 



Here the series on the right hand side is to be broken off at the last positive 
power of n t for (/^ } f ( ) vanishes not only when / (/t) (x) = 0, but also 
(by 297 b) when f (K) (x) is identically equal to a non- vanishing constant. 
Thus by transferring n p to the right hand side we have 

1* + 2 +... + (- 1)" 



526 Chapter XIV. Euler's summation formula and asymptotic expansions. 

or since there is no constant term appearing inside the brackets 
on the right hand side 



2. The sums dealt with above can be obtained in quite a differ- 
ent way. If we imagine that each term of the sum 



is expanded in powers of t, the coefficient of r is obviously 



On the other hand, if we use symbolic notation (cf. 105,5), the first 
sum is equal to 

e nt 1 e nt 1 e (n+B)t e Bt 

___ = ___ eSt= _ 

Hence we immediately obtain the expression 



for the coefficient of . 

3. If we put f(x) = e ax , n = l, we obtain 



or 



Since we can immediately prove, by 208, 6, that the remainder tends 
to zero in this case, provided only that ||< 2n, we have, for these 
values of cc, 



which is the expansion stated in 105. 

Similarly, by putting f(x) = cos ax, n = l, we obtain the expan 
sion 115 for -cot. 



64. Euler's summation formula. B. Applications. 627 

4. If we put f(x) = y-r , we have, by replacing n by (n 1), 



_i_ B */i M / 

^ ----- r 2M 1 5J ( 

Since here we may let M > oo , just as on p. 521 above, we obtain the 
following refined expression for Eulers constant: 



In this case the remainder certainly docs not decrease to as A in- 
creases ; and the series J -5 diverges rapidly, so rapidly that even 



the corresponding power series J^T^M 2 * diverges everywhere; for, 
by 136, 



Nevertheless, we can evaluate C very accurately by means of the above 
expression (cf. Rem. 6 ). If we take e. g. k = 3 , we have, in the first 
instance, 



(a) 



120 



If we take only the part of the integral from x = 1 to x = 4, the 
absolute value of the error is

The required evaluation of the integral is also given by the first 
formula written down, for n = 4, namely

528 Chapter XIV. Euler's summation formula and asymptotic expansions. 

Hence 

0-5772146 < C < 0-5772168. 

In this way we can easily obtain C with much greater accuracy than 
before, and theoretically to any degree of accuracy whatever. The reason 
for this favourable state of affairs lies solely in the fact that we may regard 
the logarithms as known. 

5. We now put f(x) = log (I + x) and proceed just as we did in 
the previous examples on pp. 525 7. If we again substitute (n 1) for 
n % we first of all obtain, from 298 with k = 0, 



or 



log 1 + log 2 + + log n = /log xdx + l\ogn+f ^ dx 



log n ! = (n + 1) log n -(n-l)+f -^ d x.

Integrating by parts, we have 



1 1 

which shows that the integral converges as n -> oo. Hence we can put 
(*) log n \ == (n + 2 ) log n n + y m 

and we know that 

lim y n = Y 



exists. Its value is obtained as follows: by (*) we have 

2 log (2 4 . . . 2 n) = 2 n log 2 + 2 log n\ 

= 2 n log 2 + (2 n + 1) log n 2 n + 2 y a 

= (2 n + 1) log 2 n 2 n log 2 + 2 y n 
and 

log (2 n + 1) I = (2 n + 1) log (2 + 1) - (2 + 1) + y 2n+1 . 

By subtraction 



64. Euler's summation formula. B. Applications. 529 

If we now transfer the term -=- log (2 w + 1) to the left hand side and 
let n *oo, we know, from Wallis* product (219, 3), that 



log J/% = - 1 + 1 - log 2 + 2 y - 
so that 

Y = log v~2i* . 

Hence, finally, we have 



(**) log! = n + logn - n

If we multiply by M, the modulus of the Bnggian logarithms (pp. 256 7), 
and denote the latter logarithms by Log, we have 



Logn! = (*+ ^Logn-nM+Logv/ITi-Mj ^^) dx.

with an error < 10~ 4 in absolute value, so that 1000! is a number with 2568 
digits, which begins with the figures 402 .... 

Just as in the previous example, we can now improve our result (**) 
considerably by means of integration by parts. Since 



after 2 k steps we obtain 



f 

j 



As here the remainder (for fixed k) is less than a certain constant 
divided by w 2 *, we can also write the result in the form 



530 Chapter XIV. Euler's summation formula and asymptotic expansions. 

in which the A n 's always (i. e. for every fixed k) form a bounded sequence. 
The result in either form is usually known as Stirling's formula 7 . 

6. If we take the somewhat more general form f(x) = log (y -\- x\ 
where y > 0, Euler's formula for k = gives, to begin with, 

log y + log (y + 1) + . . . + log (y + n) = (y + n) log (y + n) n 

n 

-y logy + * (ig (y + ) + logy} + 

Hence we can obtain a corresponding expression for the gamma-function 
(v. p. 385 and pp. 439 40) as follows: subtract this equation from the 
equation (**) in the last example, add log n v to both sides, and we obtain

log r (y) = ( y - 1) log y - y + log V2^ - f-*_ dx. 



By integrating this expression by parts 2 k times (or by at once using 
Euler's formula for any value of k), we deduce the following generalized 
Stirling's formula 8 : 



log T (y) = y log y y + log 

+ #2 1 I ^*1 1 
372 J + 3~5 y 3 



7. We now put f(x) = (1 , ^5, where 5C > and 5 is arbitrary. 

As we have already dealt with the cases 5=1, 1, 2, ..., and the 
case s = is trivial, we shall consider s as being different from any of 
these values. If we again replace n by (n 1), Euler's formula now gives

C. The evaluation of remainders. 

The evaluation of the remainder in Euler's formula, which for prac- 
tical purposes is particularly important, we have avoideii hitherto. Now, 
however, the question becomes imperative whether we cannot formulate 
some general statement as to the magnitude of the remainder in Euler's 



532 Chapter XIV. Euler's summation tormula and asymptotic expansions. 

summation formula. It may be shown that, very generally, the remainder 
is of the same sign as, but smaller in absolute value than, the first term neglected, 
i. e. the term which would appear in the summation formula, if we 
replaced k by k -f- 1. This will, moreover, always be the case if f(x) has 
a constant sign for x > and if f(x) and all its derivatives tend monotonely 
to as x tends to + oo. 

In order to prove this, we must examine the graph of the function 
y = P k (x), & ^ 2, in the interval ^ x ^ 1, somewhat more closely. 
We assert that the graph is of the type represented in Fig. 14; 1, 2, 3, 4, 
according as k leaves the remainder 1, 2, 3, or 0, when divided by 4. 




Fig. 14. 

More precisely, we assert that the functions with odd suffixes have exactly 
three zeros of the first order at 0, , 1, but those with even suffixes exactly 
two zeros of the first order within the interval, and, moreover, that the 
functions have the signs shown in the graphs. More shortly: P^ (x) 
is of the type of the curve ( - I)*" 1 cos 2 TT x and P^+i (x) is of the type 
of the curve ( I)*" 1 sin 2 TT x. 

These statements are proved directly for the suffixes 2, 3, 4, by using 
the methods which follow, or they can be deduced from the explicit for- 
mulae on p. 522. We may therefore assume that the assertions arc 
proved up to P2A (#)> ^ == 2, inclusive. It is immediately obvious, by 
297, that PSA*! (*) vanishes for x = 0, J, 1, and also that 



so that P2A+1 (x) is symmetrical with respect to the point x = g, y = 0. 

Thus if P2A+1 (*) has another zero, it must have two more at least, i. e. 
five in all, and P%\(x) must have at least four zeros by Rollers theorem 
( 19, theorem 8), which is contrary to hypothesis. The sign of P2A+1 (x) 

in < x < g is the same as that of PSZA+I (0) = PZA (0), that is, the same 
as that of -82 A > i- e. the sign is given by ( I)*" 1 .

Since P^A-HI (*) = PZX+I (#), P*\ \ 2 (x) has only one stationary value 
in < x < : 1, namely at x - fc> . Its value PgAf i> f J must have the opposite 

sign to P;sA+2(0), for otherwise PZ\M(X) would have a constant sign in

which is certainly not the case, because of the periodicity of our functions. 
Finally, since PgA+aCO) has the same sign as # 2 A+2, i. e. the sign ( - 1)\ 
all our assertions are now established 9 . Since 



P2A (x) is symmetrical with respect to the line x = .

that h (x) decreases, we have 



Hence

nating, if A 0, 1, 2, ... . The exact opposite signs occur, of course, 
when h (x) is always less than and increasing. 

Now if we assume that f(x) is defined for x ^ 0, and, together with 
all its derivatives, tends monotonely to as a: -> oo, each of these deriva- 
tives is of constant sign 10 , and /<2*+D (x) has the same sign as/< 2 * +3 > (x).

immediately from the relation

onwards is to be included here.

Hence R k and R h + 1 have opposite signs, and therefore R k and (R k R k+ i)

But this is the "first term neglected", so that its sign also is the same as 
the sign of R k , whereas its absolute value exceeds the absolute value of 
R k > q. e. d. 

Thus we have the

stated in the simplified form

Thus in this form the series (divergent in general), of which the 
first few terms appear on the right hand side, effectively possesses the 
characteristic property of alternating series (mentioned on p. 518) which 
is particularly convenient for numerical calculations. 

Remarks and Examples. 

1. As Cauchy remarks, the characteristic property of alternating series just 
mentioned is exhibited by the geometrical series 

2 -h ^ h . . . , c > 0, * > 0, 

c + t c c 9 c 3 ' ' ' 

not only when it converges, but for arbitrary (positive) c and t. For, if we write 
it with the remainder, i. e. in the form 



it is true without exception. For any (positive) c and t, the value of the left hand 
side is represented by the n th partial sum, except for an error which has the sign 
of the first term neglected, but is less than this term in absolute value. 
If we carry out this process with the fractions

B. ti may be replaced by the one just written down, by 300. But wj may not conclude

(cf. 301, 4). We have indeed proved that both sides agree very closely for large 
values of #; but we may not conclude from the previous considerations that they 
are actually equal for any value of x. (In fact, however, the equation written above 
is true.) 

3. Just as before, we can also briefly evaluate the remainder in the examples 
4, 5, 6, 7 of section B., from the fact that the remainder has the same sign as, but 
is smaller in absolute value than, the "first term neglected". For it is immediately 
obvious that the functions / (x) used in these examples satisfy the hypotheses of the 
theorem 300. 

65. Asymptotic series. 

We now return to the introductory remarks of 64, A. The series 
which we obtain from Euler's summation formula in examples 4 7, 
by continuing the expansion to infinity instead of writing down the 
remainder, are divergent. In the cases when they are power series in 

- or -, we can say, more precisely, that they are power series which 

diverge everywhere. In spite of this, they can be employed in 
practice, since examination of the remainder shows that the error 
corresponding to a particular partial sum is smaller in absolute value 



536 Chapter XIV. Euler's summation formula and asymptotic expansions. 

than, and of the same sign as, the first term neglected. Now at first 
these terms decrease, and become even very small for large values of 
the variable; it is only later on that they increase to a high value. Hence 
the series can be used for numerical calculations in spite of its di- 
vergence; with limited accuracy, to be sure, but with an accuracy 
which is often close enough to be sufficient for the most refined practical 
purposes (in Astronomy in particular) 11 . Moreover, the larger the variable 
is, the more readily does the series yield the results just mentioned. 
More precisely: if (as in B, 5 and 6) the expansion obtained from 
Euler's summation formula is of the form 



not only do we have 



as x~*oo, for every fixed k, but even 



A general investigation of this property of the expansions was 
lade almost simultaneously by Th. J. Stieltjes 12 and H. Poincard. 
bllowing the older usage, Stieltjes calls our series semi-convergent, 
term which emphasizes the fact that so far as numerical purposes 
re concerned they behave almost like convergent series. Poincare, 
n the other hand, speaks of asymptotic series y thus putting the last- 
lentioned property, which can be accurately defined, in the foreground. 
'he older term has not held its ground, although it is often used, 
specially in astronomical literature. The reason is that it clashes with 
le terminology which is customary, particularly in France, whereby 
ur conditionally convergent series are called semi-convergent. We 
hall therefore adopt Poi ncar&'s term, and we proceed to set up the 
blowing exact

299, 4. This interpretation is not valid, however, even from the general view- 
point of 59, for the investigations of 64 have provided no process by which 
the sum in question may be obtained from the partial sums of thq series by a 
convergent process, as was always the case in Chap. XIII.

65. Asymptotic series. 537 



Definition. A series of the form ^o + ^+^H ---- (which need 301. 
not converge for any value of x) is called an asymptotic representation 
(or expansion) of a function F(x) which is defined for every suffi- 
ciently large positive value of x, if, for every (fixed) n = 0, 1, 2,..., 



as x * -f- oo: and we shall write symbolically 



Remarks and Examples. 

1. Here the coefficients a n are not bound to satisfy any conditions, since 

the series ^~ need not converge. They may be complex, in fact, if F(x) 
x 

is a complex function of the real variable #. The variable may also be com- 
plex, in which case x must approach infinity along a fixed radius am x --- con- 
stant; for the asymptotic expansion may be different for each radius. In what 
follows we shall set these generalizations aside and henceforward suppose alJ 
the quantities to be real 

On the other hand, it frequently happens that the function F(x\ is defined 
for integral values of the variable only; e. g. 

1 + 2* + . . . + *P, 1 -j- \ + . . . + 1 . 

* x 

In such cases we shall usually denote the variable by k, v, n, . . . Then F(x) simply 
represents a sequence, the terms of which are asymptotically expressed as functions 
of the integral variables. 

2. If the series JjJ-J does converge for #> R, and represents the func- 

x 

tion F(x), the series is obviously an asymptotic representation of F(x) in this 
case also. Thus .examples of asymptotic representation can be obtained from 
any convergent power series. 

3. The question whether a function F(x) possesses an asymptotic re- 
presentation, and what the values of the coefficients are, is immediately settled 
in theory by the fact that the successive limiting values (for a;-*--f-oo) 



must exist. In fact, however, the decision can seldom be made in this way, 
but these simple considerations show that any function can have only one 
asymptotic expansion. 

4. On the other hand, for f(x) = e-* t a?>0, all the a n 's are zero, since

a result which shows that different functions may have the same asymptotic 
expansion. Thus, if F(x) has an asymptotic representation, e. g. 



have the same asymptotic representation. 

It was for this reason that we could not inter that the two functions 
mentioned in 3OO, 2 were identical. 

5. Geometrically speaking, the curves 

y=o + + ...-f- and y = F(x) 

X X 

have contact of at least the n** order at infinity; and the contact becomes 
closer as n increases. 

6. For applications it is advantageous to use the notation 

F <*)~/(*) + g (*) (00+ 2* + a x l + ...), 

where / (x) and g (x) are any two functions which are defined for sufficiently large 
values of x t and such that, further, g (x) never vanishes. This notation is intended 
essentially to express that 



Some of the examples worked out in 64, B may be regarded as giving the asymptotic 
expansions, in this sense, of the functions involved, for we may now write

Calculations with asymptotic series. 

In many respects we can make calculations with asymptotic series 
just as we do with convergent series. 

It is immediately obvious that from

It is almost as easy to see that the product of the functions also 
possesses an asymptotic expansion, and that

as if all the expansions were convergent series^ provided only that the denom- 
inator of the rational function does not vanish when the constant terms of 
the asymptotic expansions are substituted for z lt # 2 , . . , , #. 

Further, the following theorem also holds: 

Theorem 2. If g (z) = a + 04 z + . . . + a n z n + . . . is a power series 
with positive radius r y if F (x) possesses the asymptotic representation 



and if \ a \ <r, the function of a function 



which is obviously defined for every sufficiently large x, since F (x) -> # 
as x -> + > an d since \ a Q \ < r also possesses an asymptotic repre- 

sentation, and this is again calculated exactly as if 2 -^ were convergent.

Proof. In order to calculate the coefficients of the expansion of

where we put

for short. This expansion (*) converges whenever |/(#)| < T |ol 
which is certainly the case for every sufficiently large value of x, whether 

2 ^converges or not, since in fact /(#)->() as x -> oo. In accordance 
with the part of theorem 1 which has already been proved, from 



we deduce the asymptotic expansion

for every k = 1, 2, 3, . . . . Here the quantities a^ ' have quite definite

It remains to show that 27 ~ is an asymptotic expansion of <J> (#), that 
is, that the expression

Now if e x = E! (#), e 2 ^ e 2 (#) denote certain functions which 
tend to as JC->QO, it follows from (*) and (**) that 



Hence, since / n+1 may be put equal to n ^ x , 



and our assertion follows at a glance, for the expression in the last square

Hence we "may" divide by asymptotic expansions with non-vanishing

Taking g (z) = e z y we obtain, without any restrictions, 



In particular, we may write, by 299, 5,

66. Special cases of asymptotic expansions. 543 

Theorems 1 3 lay the foundation for Poincarffs very fruitful 
applications of asymptotic series to the solution of differential equations 14 . 
A detailed account lies outside the plan of this book, however, and 
we must content ourselves by giving an example of this application 
of asymptotic series in the following section. 



66. Special cases of asymptotic expansions. 

The use of asymptotic expansions raises two main questions: 
first there is the question whether the function under consideration 
possesses an asymptotic expansion at all, and how it is to be found 
in a given case (the expansion problem); on the other hand, there is 
the question how the function, or rather, a function, is to be found, 
which is represented by a given asymptotic expansion (the summation 
problem). In the case of both questions, the answers available in the 
present state of knowledge are not completely satisfactory as yet, for 
although they are very numerous and in part of remarkably wide 
range, they are somewhat isolated and lack methodical and funda- 
mental connections. This section will therefore consist rather of a 
collection of representative examples than of a satisfactory solution of 
the two problems. 

A. Examples of the expansion problem. 

1. From the theoretical point of view, the expansion of given 303 
functions was thoroughly dealt with in the note 301, 3; but it is only 
seldom that the required determinations of limits can all be carried 

out. The method also fails if lim F (x) does not exist, i. e. if only an 

->QO 

asymptotic expansion in the more general sense mentioned in 301, 6 
can be considered. It is only when f(x) and g(x), the functions in- 
volved, have been found that we can proceed as in 301, 3. 

2. We have learned that asymptotic series very frequently arise 
from Enter' s summation formula: but there it is not so much a 
case of expanding given functions as that by special choice of the 
function f(x) in the summation formula we are often led to valuable 
expansions. 

3. As we have already emphasized, hitherto perhaps the most 
important application of asymptotic expansions is Poincarfs use of 
them in the theory of differential equations 14 . The simple fundamental 



14 A very clear account of the contents of Pomcar&s paper, including alJ 
the essential points, is given by E. Borel in his "Lecons sur les series diver- 
gentes" (v. 



644 Chapter XIV. Euler's summation formula and asymptotic expansions. 

idea is this : suppose we know that a function y = F (x) satisfies a 
differential equation of the w th order 



where denotes a rational function of the variables involved. Now 
if we know that y = F (a?) and its first n derivatives all possess asymptotic 
representations, the expansions for y', y", ..., y< n > follow, by 302 
Theorem 3, from the first one, 



If we substitute these expansions in the differential equation, in accord 
ance with 3O2, Theorem 1, we must obtain an expansion which stands 
for 0, all the coefficients of which must therefore vanish. From 
the equations obtained in this way, together with the initial condi- 
tions, the coefficients and hence the expression for F(x) are in general 
found. 

Thus e. g. the function 



which is defined for x > 0, has for its derivative 



X 

that is, it satisfies the differential equation 

1 



for x > . It may be proved directly but we cannot give the details 
here that this equation has only one solution y such that y and y' 
exist for x > X Q I> and have an asymptotic representation. If we 
accordingly set 

y~o + -S- + 3-+-' so that y '^_||._y?_...; 
we have the equations 



whence it follows that 

*o = > i = l> a = 1, ..., fl n + 1 = ( l) n n! ..... 
We therefore find that

4. The function in the previous example can be asymptotically 
expanded by another method, which is frequently applicable. If we 
put t = u + x, we have

Here, by Cauchy's observation (v. 3OO, l), we can put 



for all positive values of x and u. It follows that 



Thus we have again found the expansion in the last example 15 . 

5. If /(w) is a function which is defined for u^O and is positive 
there, and if the integrals 



J/ ()-i <* = (- !)-' 



. 







exist for every integral n ^ 1, we similarly obtain the asymptotic expan- 
sion 



for the function 



Moreover, the partial sums of this series represent F(x), except for an 
error which is less in absolute value than the first term neglected and is 
of the same sign as the latter. Expansions of this kind have been investi- 
gated especially by Th. J. Stieltjes 10 . (For further particulars, see below, 
B, p. 549.) 



"The function e~* F (x) = f -^> which becomes ~jf j^~ with the 

x 

transformation e~ i = v, is known as the Logarithmic-integral function of y e~~*.

Fac. des Sciences de Toulouse, Vols. 8 and 9, 1894 and 1895. 



546 Chapter XIV. Euler's summation formula and asymptotic expansions. 

6. Certain methods requiring the more advanced resources of the 
, theory of functions date back to Laplace, but have recently been ex- 
tended by E. W. Barnes, H. Burkhardt 18 , 0. Perron 19 , and G. Faber 20 . 
We cannot go into details, but must content ourselves with the following 
remarks. Barnes gives the asymptotic expansions of many integral 

functions, e.g. n \(n+&}' (* ^ > ~~ 1 * ~~ 2 ' "")' and similar func ' 
tions. Besides the expansions we have met with, O. Perron obtains as 
examples the asymptotic expansion in terms of n of certain integrals which 
occur in the theory of Keplerian motion, such as 

+a 

J e n(t-esmt)i 
l-.cogf dt ' lo < c ^ 1 , w an integer), 



From our point of view it is noteworthy that in these examples the 
terms of the expansion do not proceed by integral powers of , but by 
fractional powers. Thus the expansion of C(ri) is of the form 



This suggests another extension of the definition 301, 6, which, however, 
we shall not discuss. 

Numerous additional examples of asymptotic expansions of this 
kind, in particular those of trigonometrical integrals occurring in physical 
and astronomical investigations, are to be found in the article by H. Burk- 
hardt: "Uber trigonometrische Reihen und Integrate", in the Enzyklo- 
padie der mathematischen Wissenschaften, Vol. II, 1, pp. 815 1354. 

7. An expansion, which was first given by L. Feyer 21 , and was 
subsequently treated in detail by O. Perron 22 , is of a more specialized 

nature; its object is to deduce an asymptotic representation for the 

t 
coefficients of the expansion in power series of e 1 " X 9 or, more gener-

8. Finally, we draw attention to the fact that the asymptotic repre- 
sentation of certain functions forms the subject of many profound in- 
vestigations in the analytical theory of numbers. In fact, our examples 
301, 6, a, b, and d, belong to this class, for the functions expanded have 
a meaning only for integral values of the variable in the first instance. 
Just to indicate the nature of such expansions, we give a few more examples, 
without proof: 

a) If T (n) denotes the number of divisors of n, 



+ (2 C- 



where C is Euler's constant 25 . Regarding the next term 26 , practically 
all that is known is that it is lower in degree than n~% but not lower than 
n~*. 

b) If a (n) denotes the sum of the divisors of w, 

a (l) + q(2) + . + (*) ^ tr" ^ _ .

d) If TT (ri) denotes the number of primes not greater than w, 



In all these and in many similar cases, it is not known whether a 
complete asymptotic expansion exists. Hence the relation which we have 
written down only means that the difference of the right and left hand 
sides is of smaller order, as regards n y than the last term on the right hand 
side. 

e) If p (n) denotes the number of different ways in which n may be 
partitioned into a sum of (equal or unequal) positive integers 27 ,

ceeded by means of very profound investigations in continuing the 

expansion to terms of the order -- . 



B. Examples of the summation problem. 

304. Here we have to deal with the converse question, that of rinding a 
function F(x) whose asymptotic expansion 



is an assigned, everywhere divergent series 2 ^. The answers "to this ques- 
tion are still more isolated and lacking in generality than those of the previous 
division. 

When the function F (x) is found, it has some claim to be regarded 

as the "sum* 1 of the divergent series 2 in the sense of 59, since it 

becomes more and more closely related to the partial sums of the series 
as their index increases. This is the case only to a very limited extent, 
however, since, as we have already emphasized, the function F (x) is not 



17 E. g. (4) = 5, since 4 admits of the five partitions: 4, 3 + 1, 2 + 2, 
2 + 1 + 1, and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.

itself.

defined uniquely by the series. Thus the question how far F(x) behaves 
like the "sum" of the series can only be investigated in each particular 
case a posteriori. 

1 . The most important advance in this direction was made by Stieltjes 30 . 
We saw above (v. A, 5), that a function given in the form 



F(X ) = m- du 

' J x + u 



possesses the asymptotic expansion ^ in which 

(*) (- I)"' 1 = //() "-' d u, (n = 1, 2, 3, . . .) 



Conversely, if we are given the expansion 2 a ~, with coefficients a l9 a 2 , 

# 3 , . . . , and if we can discover a positive function f(u) defined in u > 0, 
for which the integral in (*) has the given values a l9 a 2> #31..., for 
n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , then the function 



will be a solution of the given summation problem, by A. 5. The problem 
of finding, given a n> a function f(u) which srtisfies the set of equations (*) 
is now called Stieltjes 9 problem of moments. Stieltjes gives the necessary 
and sufficient conditions for it to be capable of solution, and, in particular, 
for the existence of just one solution, with very general assumptions. In 
particular, if/(w), and hence F(x), is uniquely determined by the problem 

of moments such a series 2 a - is called a Stieltjes series for short we 

#n J 

are more justified in claiming F (x) as a sum of the divergent series 27 ~^, for 
instance as its S-sum. 

Lack of space prevents us from entering into closer details of these 
very comprehensive investigations. An account which includes every- 
thing essential is given by E. Borel in his "Leons sur les series divergentes", 
which we have repeatedly referred to. As an example, suppose we are given 
the series 

/4A X 1! l 2! 3! 

(t) " + - + -----

fraction continue d'une sine proceclant suivant les puissances descendantes d'une 
variable, Annales de la Fac, Scienc, Toulouse Vol. 3, H. 1 17. 1889, 



550 Chapter XIV. Euler's summation formula and asymptotic expansions. 
The statement of the problem of moments is 

//() iC- 1 du = (-!)!, n=l,2, . , 



which obviously possesses the solution /() = e~ u . In this case we can 
prove without difficulty that the above is the only solution. Hence in 



QO 

/ U 
e ^_ du 
x + u 



we have not only found a function whose asymptotic expansion is the 
given series, but, in the sense of 59, we can regard F (x) as the ^S-sum 3l 
of the (everywhere) divergent series (f). 

2. The appeal to the theory of differential equations is just as useful 
in the summation problem as in the expansion problem (v. A, 3). Fre- 
quently we can write down the differential equation which is formally 
satisfied by a given series and among the solutions there may be a function 
whose asymptotic expansion is the original series. As a rule, however, 
matters are not as described above, nor as in A. 3, but the differential 
equation itself is the primary problem. It is only when this equation can 
be solved formally by means of an asymptotic series, as was indicated 
in A, 3, and provided we succeed in summing the scries directly that we 
can hope to obtain a solution of the differential equation in this way. Other- 
wise we must try to deduce the properties of the solution from the asymp- 
totic expansion. Poincarfs researches 32 , which were extended later, 
especially by A. Kneser and J. Horn 33 , deal with this problem, which lies 
outside the scope of this book. 

3. In Stieltjes* process the coefficients a n were recovered, so to speak,

81 Thus for x = 1 we obtain the value 

u = 0-596347 . . . 



for the .9-sum of the divergent series 2 ( l) n ! This series had already been 

n-Q 

studied by Euler (who obtained the same value for its sum), Lacroix, and Laguerre. 
Laguerre's work formed the starting-point of Stieltjes 1 investigations.

and hence the series by 



In place of the series 2 x n there now appears the very simple geometrical 
series, multiplied through by the factor f(u). The solution of the problem 
of moments is necessary in order to determine /(*/), and this is usually 
not easy. We can, however, make the process more elastic by putting 

Un 



and choosing the factors c n firstly so that the problem of moments 

c n = Jf(u)u n du 



is soluble, and secondly so that the power series 

**()* 

c n W 

represents a known function. Thus we can for instance link up in this 
way with Borel's summation process, by putting c n ~ n !. If the function 



c n x/ 
can be regarded as known, then 



o 

is a solution of the given summation problem M . Here we cannot discuss 
the details of the assumptions under which this method leads to the desired 



34 The connection with Borel's summation process can be established as 
follows. The function

which was introduced in 59, 7 for the definition of Borers process, has for its 
derivative

in the text.

result. We shall conclude with a few examples of this method of sum- 
mation: in these, of course, the question whether the function found is 
really represented by the series must remain unsettled, since we have not 
proved any general theorems. It can, however, easily be verified a posteriori. 

a) For the series

which we have already discussed in 1, we have

and accordingly 



By integration by parts, it is easily shown that the function is identical 
with that discussed in 1.

in the calculus of probabilities.
